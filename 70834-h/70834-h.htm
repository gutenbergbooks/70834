<p class="drop-cap">In this volume of essays relating to one of
the most vital and pressing problems
which has ever confronted a people, no
pretence is made that the subject has been fully
discussed. All that is claimed is that an attempt
is made, after years of study and of more or
less familiarity with some phases of the Problem,
to present them plainly, candidly and, as
far as possible, temperately. It is not even
claimed that this is wholly possible. No man
can entirely dissociate himself from the conditions
amid which he grew up, or free himself
from the influences which surrounded him
in his youth. The most he can do is to strive
earnestly for an open and enlarged mind and
try to look at everything from the highest and
soundest standpoint he can reach. If he does
this and tries to tell the truth absolutely as he
sees it, though he may not have given the exact
truth, he will, possibly, have done his part to
help others find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>It is not claimed that the author is absolutely
correct in all of his propositions. Sometimes
the information on which they are based is,
possibly, incorrect; the classification of facts incomplete
or inexact; and, no doubt, his deductions
are occasionally erroneous; but no proposition
has been advanced for which he does not
believe he has sound authority; no fact has been
stated without what appears to him convincing
proof, and whatever error his deductions contain
may readily be detected, as they are plainly
stated.</p>

<p>Although it has appeared at one time or another
that the race question was in process of
settlement, yet always, just when that hope
seemed brightest, it has been dashed to the
ground, and the Question has reappeared in
some new form as menacing as ever. In fact,
it is much too weighty and far-reaching to be
disposed of in a short time. Where ten millions
of one race, which increases at a rate that doubles
its numbers every forty years, confront
within the borders of one country another race,
the most opposite to it on earth, there must
exist a question grave enough in the present and
likely to become stupendous in the future. Next
to Representative Government, this is to-day the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
most tremendous question which faces directly
one-third of the people of the United States, and
only less immediately all of them. It includes
the labor question of the South, and must, in
time, affect that of the whole country. It does
more; it affects all those conditions which make
life endurable and, perhaps, even possible in a
dozen States of the Union. Wherever it exists,
it is so vital that it absorbs for the time
being all the energies of the people, and excludes
due consideration of every other question
whatsoever.</p>

<p>In dealing with this Question in the past,
nearly every mistake that could possibly be
made has been made, and to-day, after more
than thirty-five years of peace and of material
prosperity, the Question is apparently as live
as it was over a generation ago, when national
passion was allowed to usurp the province of
deliberation, and the Negro was taught two
fundamental errors: first, that the Southern
white was inherently his enemy, and, secondly,
that his race could be legislated into equality
with the white.</p>

<p>One unfortunate fact is that that portion of
the white race living at a distance from the region
where the Problem is most vital have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
trained to hold almost universally one theory
as to the Question, while the portion who face
the problem every day of their lives have quite
solidly held a view absolutely the opposite.</p>

<p>A singular feature of this difference in the
views held by the two sections is that whatever
Southerners have said about conditions at the
South relating to the Negroes has usually been
received incredulously at the North, and it is
only when some Northerner has seen those conditions
for himself and found the views of the
Southerners to be sound that those views were
accepted. Thus, we have had exhibited the
curious fact that evidence upon a most vital
matter has been accepted rather with reference
to the sectional status of the witness than to his
opportunity for exact knowledge.</p>

<p>A Southerner may be a high-minded and philanthropic
gentleman, whose views would be
sought and whose word would be taken on
every other subject; he may be carrying his old
slaves as pensioners; he may treat the weakest
and worst of them with that mingled consideration
and indulgence which is so commonly to
be found in the South; but if he expresses the
results of a lifetime of knowledge of the Negro’s
character, it counts for nothing with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
large class who fancy themselves the only
friends of the Negro.</p>

<p>The reason for this has, undoubtedly, been
the belief held by many Northerners that the
Southerners were inherently incapable of doing
justice to the negroes. Happily for the proper
solution of the question, except with that portion
of the people who belong to the generation
to whom the Baptist cried in the wilderness, this
state of mind is more or less passing away, and
men of all sections are awakening to the need
for a proper solution.</p>

<p>In this discussion, one thing must be borne
in mind: In characterizing the Negroes generally,
it is not meant to include the respectable
element among them, except where this is
plainly intended. Throughout the South there
is such an element, an element not only respectable,
but universally respected. To say that
Negroes furnish the great body of rapists, is
not to charge that all Negroes are ravishers.
To say that they are ignorant and lack the first
element of morality, is not to assert that they
all are so. The race question, however, as it
exists in the South, is caused by the great body
of the race, and after forty years in which money
and care have been given unstintedly to uplift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
them, those who possess knowledge and virtue
are not sufficient in number and influence to
prevent the race question from growing rather
than diminishing.</p>

<p>De Tocqueville, more than a century ago,
declared that he was obliged to confess that he
did not regard the abolition of slavery as a
means of warding off the struggle of the two
races in the Southern States. Thomas Jefferson
pronounced the same view, and declared that
they must be separated. In the light of modern
conditions, it would appear as though, unless
conditions change, these views may be verified.
It may even be possibly true, as some
believe, that, with the present increase of the
two races going on, whether the Negro race
be educated and enlightened or not, the most
dangerous phases of the problem would still
exist in the mere continuance together of the
two races.</p>

<p>It is with the hope of throwing some light
on this great Question that these studies have
been made.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Among the chief problems which have
vexed the country for the last century
and threaten to give yet more trouble
in the future, is what is usually termed “The
Negro Question.” To the South, it has been
for nearly forty years the chief public question,
overshadowing all others, and withdrawing her
from due participation in the direction and
benefit of the National Government. It has
kept alive sectional feeling; has inflamed partisanship;
distorted party policies; barred complete
reconciliation; cost hundreds of millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of money, and hundreds if not thousands of
lives, and stands ever ready, like Banquo’s
ghost, to burst forth even at the feast.</p>

<p>For the last few years it has appeared to
be in process of being settled, and settled along
the lines which the more conservative element
of the white race at the South has deemed for
the permanent good of both races, a view in
which the best informed element at the North
apparently acquiesced. The States which the
greater part of the most ignorant element of
the Negro race inhabited had substantially
eliminated this element from the participation
in political government, but had provided qualifications
for suffrage which would admit to
participation therein any element of the race
sufficiently educated to meet what might to an
impartial man appear a reasonable requirement.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Meantime, the whites were taxing
themselves heavily and were doing all in their
power to give the entire race the education
which would enable them to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>Those whites who know the race best and
hold the most far-reaching conception of the
subject maintain that this disfranchisement was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
necessary, and, even of the Negro race, those
who are wisest and hold the highest ideal for
their people acquiesced in this—at least, to the
extent of recognizing that the Negroes at large
needed a more substantial foundation for full
citizenship than they had yet attained—and
were preaching and teaching the imperative
necessity of the race’s applying its chief energies
to building itself up industrially.</p>

<p>The South, indeed, after years of struggle,
considered that the question which had confronted
it and largely affected its policy for
more than a third of a century was sufficiently
settled for the whites to divide once more on
the great economic questions on which hang the
welfare and progress of the people. Suddenly,
however, there has been a recrudescence of the
whole question, and it might appear to those
who base their opinion wholly on the public
prints as though nothing had been accomplished
toward its definite settlement in the last generation.</p>

<p>Only the other day, the President extended
a casual social invitation to the most distinguished
educator of the colored race: one who
is possibly esteemed at the South the wisest and
sanest man of color in the country, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
has, perhaps, done more than any other to
carry out the ideas that the Southern well-wishers
of his race believe to be the soundest
and most promising of good results. And the
effect was so unexpected and so far-reaching
that it astonished and perplexed the whole
country. On the other hand, this educator,
speaking in Boston to his race in a reasonable
manner on matters as to which he is a high authority,
was insulted by an element, the leaders
of which were not the ignorant members of his
race, but rather the more enlightened—college-bred
men and editors—and a riot took place in
the church in which he spoke, in which red pepper
and razors were used quite as if the occasion
had been a “craps-game” in a Southern
Negro settlement. The riot was quelled by
the police; but, had it been in a small town,
murder might easily have been done.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, it is apparent that the
matter is more complicated than appears at first
thought, and must be dealt with carefully.</p>

<p>One great trouble is the different way in
which the body of the people at the North and
at the South regard this problem. We have
presented to us the singular fact that two sections
of the same race, with the same manners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and customs, the same traits of character, the
same history and, until within a time so recent
that the divergence is within the memory of
living men, the same historical relation to the
Negro race, should regard so vital a question
from such opposite points; the one esteeming
the question to be merely as to the legal equality
of the races, and the other passionately holding
it to be a matter that goes to the very foundation
of race-domination and race-integrity.
What adds to the anomaly is the pregnant fact
that the future of these two sections must hereafter
run on together; their interests become
ever more and more identified, and if the one
is right in holding that its position is founded
on a racial instinct, the other, in opposing it, is
fighting against a position which it must eventually
assume. Yet, their views have up to the
present been so divergent—they have, indeed,
been so diametrically opposed to each other,
that if one is right, the other must be radically
wrong.</p>

<p>Another difficulty in the way of a sound solution
of the problem is the blind bigotry of the
doctrinaire, which infects so many worthy persons.
An estimable gentleman from Boston,
of quite national reputation, observed a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
time ago that it was singular that the Southerners
who had lived all their lives among the
Negroes should understand them so little, while
they of the North who knew them so slightly
should yet comprehend them so fully. He
spoke seriously and this was without doubt his
sincere belief. This would be amusing enough
were it not productive of such unhappy consequences.
It represents the conviction of a considerable
element. Because they have been
thrown at times with a few well-behaved, self-respecting
Negroes, or have had in their employ
well-trained colored servants, they think they
know the whole subject better than those who,
having lived all their life in touch with its most
vital problems, have come to feel in every fibre
of their being the deep significance of its manifestations.
Such a spirit is the most depressing
augury that confronts those who sincerely wish
to settle the question on sound principles.</p>

<p>With a Negro population which has increased
in the last forty years from four and
a half millions to nine millions, of whom eight
millions inhabit the South and four and a half
millions inhabit the six Southern Atlantic and
Gulf States, where in large sections they outnumber
the whites two and three to one, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
some parishes ten to one;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with this population
owning less than 4 per cent. of the
property and furnishing from 85 to 93 per
cent. of the total number of criminals; with
the two races drifting further and further
apart, race-feeling growing, and with ravishing
and lynching spreading like a pestilence
over the country, it is time that all sensible
men should endeavor as far as possible to dispel
preconceived theories and look at the subject
frankly and rationally.</p>

<p>It must appear to all except the doctrinaire
and those to whose eyes, seared by the red-hot
passions of the war and the yet more angry
passions of the Reconstruction period, no ray
of light can ever come, that it is of vital importance
that a sound solution of the problem
should be reached. It behooves all who discuss
it to do so in the most dispassionate and
catholic spirit possible. The time has passed
for dealing with the matter either in a spirit
of passion or of cocksure conceit. Well-meaning
theorists, and what Hawthorne termed
“those steel machines of the devil’s own make,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
philanthropists,” have with the best intentions
“confused counsel” and made a mess of the
matter. And after nearly forty years, in which
money, brains, philanthropy, and unceasing
effort have been poured out lavishly, the most
that we have gotten out of it is the experience
that forty years have given, and a sad experience
it is. The best-informed, the most clear-sighted
and straight-thinking men of the North
admit sadly that the experiment of Negro suffrage,
entered into with so much enthusiasm and
sustained at so frightful a cost, has proved a
failure, as those who alone knew the Negro
when the experiment was undertaken prophesied
it must, in the nature of things, prove. Only
those who, having eyes, see not, and ears, but
will not hear, still shut up their senses and, refusing
to take in the plain evidences before
them, babble of outworn measures—measures
that never had a shred of economic truth for
their foundation, and, based originally upon
passion, have brought only disaster to the whites
and little better to those whom they were intended
to uplift.</p>

<p>Two principles may be laid down to which,
perhaps, all will assent. First, it is absolutely
essential that a correct understanding of the
question should be had; and, secondly, the only
proper settlement of it is one that shall be
founded on justice and wisdom—a justice which
shall embrace all concerned.</p>

<p>It is important that, at the very outset, we
should start with proper bearings. Therefore,
though it would hardly appear necessary to
advert to the historical side of the question, yet
so much ignorance is displayed about it in the
discussion that goes on, that, perhaps, the statement
of a few simple historical facts will serve
to throw light on the subject and start us
aright.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Until a recent period, slavery existed as an
institution almost all over the world. Christianity,
while it modified its status, recognized
it, and, up to the time of the abolition of the
institution, those who defended it drew their
strongest arguments from the sacred writings.
Pious Puritans sent their ships to ply along
the middle passage, and deemed that they were
doing God and man a service to transport benighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
savages to serve an enlightened and
Christian people. Pious and philanthropic
churchmen bought these slaves as they might
have bought any other chattels.</p>

<p>The abolition of slavery came about gradually,
and was due rather to economic than to
moral reasons. When, in 1790, slavery was
abolished, by a more or less gradual system, in
the Northern States, it was chiefly because of
economic conditions. There were at that time
less than 42,000 slaves in all the Northern
States, and the system was not profitable there;
whereas there were over 700,000 slaves in the
Southern States, and it appeared that the system
there was profitable. But the balance had
not then been struck.</p>

<p>Though a respectable party of the representatives
of the Southern States advocated its
abolition at that time, it was retained because
of economic conditions. From these facts,
which are elementary, one cannot avoid the conclusion
that whatever difference existed in the
relation of the races in various sections was
due to economic causes rather than to moral or
religious feeling. In fact, during the Colonial
period, so far from slavery having any moral
aspect to the great body of the people, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
generally regarded as a beneficent institution.
The Quakers, a sect who, having known oppression
themselves, knew how to feel for the oppressed,
and a small proportion of the most
far-seeing in both sections, were exceptions.
Thomas Jefferson, for instance, was as strong
an advocate of emancipation as James Otis and
a much stronger advocate than John Adams.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When the principle that all men are created
equal was enunciated in the Declaration of Independence,
a great majority of those who
signed it had no idea of embracing within its
category the enslaved Africans. To have done
so would have been to stultify themselves. And
whether or not Thomas Jefferson at heart felt
the far-reaching scope of his enunciation, he
gave no evidence of it at the time.</p>

<p>The Negro was discussed and legislated
about as a chattel by the very men who issued
that great charter. The whites had conquered
this country from the savage and the wild, and
they had no misgivings about their rights.</p>

<p>The inclusion of three-fifths of the Negroes
in the representation of the several States was
stated by Jefferson to have grown out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
claim made by Adams and certain other Northern
representatives that they should be taxed
just as the whites were taxed, every slave being
counted for this purpose just as every white
laborer was counted. This view the Southerners
opposed and the matter was adjusted by a
compromise which reckoned only three out of
every five slaves.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Representation naturally
followed.</p>

<p>It was, however, impossible that the spirit
of liberty should be so all-pervading and not
in time be felt to extend to all men—even to
the slaves; but the growth of the idea was slow,
and it was so inextricably bound up with party
questions that it was difficult to consider it on
its own merits. To show this, it is only necessary
to recall that, in 1832, Virginia, through
her Legislature, came within one vote of abolishing
slavery within her borders, and that, in
1835, William Lloyd Garrison was dragged
through the streets of Boston by a mob—an
outrage which he says was planned and executed,
not by the rabble or workingmen, but
“by gentlemen of property and standing from
all parts of the city.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Fugitive-slave laws found their first examples
in the colonial treaties of Massachusetts;
yet in time fugitive-slave laws and the attempt
to enforce them against the sentiment of communities
where slavery had passed away played
their part in fostering a sentiment of championship
of the Negro race.</p>

<p>Then came “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” which
was the nail that, in the hands of a woman,
fastened Sisera to the ground. It presented
only one side of the question and did more,
perhaps, than any one thing that ever occurred
to precipitate the war. It aroused and crystallized
feeling against the South throughout the
world. For the first time, the world had the
imaginable horrors of slavery presented in a
manner that appealed alike to old and young,
the learned and the ignorant, the high-born
and the lowly. It blackened the fame of the
Southern people in the eyes of the North and
fixed in the mind of the North a concept
not only of the institution of slavery, but of
the Southern people, which lasted for more than
a generation, and has only begun of late, in the
light of a fuller knowledge, to be dislodged.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Mr. Lincoln has been so generally declared
to be the emancipator of the Negro race that it
is probable the facts in all their significance will
never be generally received. The abolition of
slavery was no doubt his desire; but the preservation
of the Union was his passion. And,
whatever Mr. Lincoln may have felt on the subject
of emancipation, he was too good a lawyer
and too sound a statesman to act with the inconsiderate
haste that has usually been accredited
him. It was rather what he might do than
what he actually did that alarmed the South
and brought about secession. And the menace
of destruction of the Union soon demanded all
his energies and forced him to relegate to the
background even the emancipation of the
slaves.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>On the 22d of December, 1860, after South
Carolina had seceded, he declared that the
South would be in no more danger of being
interfered with as to slavery by a Republican
administration than it was in the days of Washington.
In his inaugural address he declared:
“I have no more purpose, directly or indirectly,
to interfere with the institution of slavery in
the States where it now exists. I believe I
have no right to do so and I have no inclination
to do so.” This declaration he had already
made before. Indeed, he expressly declared in
favor of the enforcement of the fugitive-slave
law.</p>

<p>Congress, in July, 1861, adopted a resolution,
which Lincoln signed, declaring that war
was not waged for any “purpose of overthrowing
or interfering with the rights or established
institutions” of the Southern States, “but to
defend and maintain the supremacy of the
Constitution and to preserve the Union with
all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several
States unimpaired,” etc. As late as March,
1862, he declared: “In my judgment, gradual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and not sudden emancipation is best for all.”
The special message to Congress on this subject
Thaddeus Stevens stigmatized as “about the
most diluted milk-and-water gruel proposition
that has ever been given to the American people.”
The war had been going on more than
a year before a bill was passed providing that
all “slaves of persistent rebels, found in any
place occupied or commanded by the forces of
the Union, should not be returned to their masters
(as had hitherto been done under the law),
and they might be enlisted to fight for the
Union.” Mr. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation
of January 1, 1863, expresses on its face
that it was issued on “military necessity.”</p>

<p>In fact, this proclamation did not really
emancipate at all, for it applied only to those
slaves who were held in those States and “parts
of States” then “in rebellion,” and by express
exception did not extend to Negroes within the
territory under control of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>It is of record that, in some instances, owners
near the Federal lines sent their servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
into the territory occupied by the Federal troops
to evade the proclamation.</p>

<p>A story is told of an officer under General
Butler, on the James River, who, having a Negro
baby left on his hands by a refugee mother
who had returned to her home, sent the child
back to her. Someone reported that he was
sending refugee Negroes back and the matter
was investigated. His defence was that he had
sent the baby back to the only place where he
was free, to wit: within the region occupied by
the rebels.</p>

<p>Meantime, there was much reflection and no
little discussion as to the subject among the
Southern people. The loyalty of the Negroes
had made a deep impression on them, and they
were beginning to recognize the feeling of the
European countries touching slavery.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>The Thirteenth Amendment (abolishing
slavery) failed to pass in the spring of 1864
and was not passed until January 31, 1865,
when all the Republicans and thirteen Democrats
voted for it. Slavery, however, was abolished
by the final conquest of the South and
the enforced acquiescence of the Southern people,
who recognized that the collapse of the
Confederacy had effected what legal enactments
had not been able to accomplish. Returning
soldiers brought their body-servants
home with them, and on arrival informed them
that they were free; in some instances giving
them the horses they had ridden, or dividing
with them whatever money they had.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Throughout the South, the Negroes were told
by their owners that they were free, in some
cases receiving regular papers of manumission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>No race ever behaved better than the Negroes
behaved during the war. Not only were
there no massacres and no outbreaks, but even
the amount of defection was not large. While
the number who entered the Northern Army
was considerable,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> it was not as great as
might have been expected when all the facts are
taken into account. A respectable number
came from the North, while most of the others
came from the sections of the South which had
already been overrun by the armies of the
Union and where mingled persuasion and compulsion
were brought to bear.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Certainly no
one could properly blame them for yielding to
the arguments used. Their homes were more
or less broken up; organization and discipline
were relaxed, and the very means of subsistence
had become precarious; while on the other hand
they were offered bounties and glittering rewards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
that drew into the armies hundreds of
thousands of other nationalities. The number
that must be credited to refugees who left
home in the first instance for the purpose of
volunteering to fight for freedom is believed
by the writer to be not large; personally, he
never knew of one. However large the number
was, the number of those who might have
gone, and yet threw in their lot with their masters
and never dreamed of doing otherwise, was
far larger. Many a master going off to the
war intrusted his wife and children to the care
of his servants with as much confidence as if
they had been of his own blood. They acted
rather like clansmen than like bondmen. Not
only did they remain loyal, but they were nearly
always faithful to any trust that had been confided
to them. They were the faithful guardians
of their masters’ homes and families; the
trusted agents and the shrewd counsellors of
their mistresses. They raised the crops which
fed the Confederate armies, and suffered without
complaint the privations which came alike
to white and black from the exactions of war.
On the approach of the enemy, the trusted
house servants hid the family silver and valuables,
guarded horses and other property, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
resisted all temptation to desert or betray. It
must, of course, rest always on conjecture; but
the writer believes that, had the Negro been
allowed to fight for the South, more of them
would have volunteered to follow their masters
than ever volunteered in the service of the
Union. Many went into the field with their
masters, where they often displayed not only
courage but heroism, and, notwithstanding all
temptations, stood by them loyally to the end.
As Henry Grady once said, “A thousand
torches would have disbanded the Southern
Army, but there was not one.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The inference that has been drawn from this
is usually one which is wholly in favor of the
colored race. It is, however, rather a tribute
to both races. Had slavery at the South been
the frightful institution that it has ordinarily
been pictured, with the slave-driver and the
bloodhound always in the foreground, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
hardly credible that the failure of the Negroes
to avail themselves of the opportunities for
freedom so frequently offered them would have
been so general and the loyalty to their masters
have been so devoted.</p>

<p>One other reason is commonly overlooked.
The instinct for command of the white race—at
least, of that section to which the whites of
this country belong—is a wonderful thing: the
serene self-confidence which reckons no opposition,
but drives straight for the highest place,
is impressive. It made the race in the past; it
has preserved it in our time. The Negroes
knew the courage and constancy of their masters.
They had had abundant proof of them
for generations, and their masters were now in
arms.</p>

<p>The failure of a servile population to rise
against their masters in time of war is no
new thing. History furnishes many illustrations.
Plutarch tells how the besiegers of a
certain city offered, not only freedom to the
slaves, but added to it the promise of their
masters’ property and wives if they would desert
them. Yet the offer was rejected with
scorn. During the Revolution, freedom on the
same terms was offered the slaves in Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and the Carolinas by the British, but with little
effect, except to inflame the masters to bitterer
resistance.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The result was the same during
the Civil War.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The exactions of the war possibly brought
the races nearer together than they had ever
been before. There had been, in times past,
some hostile feeling between the Negroes and
the plain whites, due principally to the well-known
arrogance of a slave population toward
a poor, free, working population. This was
largely dispelled during the war, on the one
side by the heroism shown by the poor whites,
and on the other by the kindness shown by the
Negroes to their families while the men were
in the army. When the war closed, the friendship
between the races was never stronger; the
relations were never more closely welded. The
fidelity of the Negroes throughout the war was
fully appreciated and called forth a warmer affection
on the part of the masters and mistresses,
and the care and self-denial of the
whites were equally recognized by the Negroes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Nor did this relation cease with the emancipation
of the Negro. The return of the masters
was hailed with joy in the quarters as in
the mansion. When the worn and disheartened
veteran made his last mile on his return from
Appomattox, it was often the group of Negroes
watching for him at the plantation gate that
first caught his dimmed eye and their shouts of
welcome that first sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>A singular fact was presented which has not
been generally understood. The joy with
which the slaves hailed emancipation did not
relax the bonds of affection between them and
their former masters and mistresses. There
was, of course, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex necessitate rei</i>, much disorganization,
and no little misunderstanding.
The whites, defeated and broken, but unquelled
and undismayed, were unspeakably sore; the
Negroes, suddenly freed and facing an unknown
condition, were naturally in a state of
excitement. But the transition was accomplished
without an outbreak or an outrage, and,
so far as the writer’s experience and information
go, there were on either side few instances
of insolence, rudeness, or ill-temper,
incident to the break-up of the old relation.
This was reserved for a later time, when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
new poison had been instilled into the Negro’s
mind and had begun to work. Such disorders
as occurred were incident to the passing through
the country of disbanded troops, making their
way home without the means of subsistence, but
even these were sporadic and temporary.</p>

<p>For years after the war the older Negroes,
men and women, remained the faithful guardians
of the white women and children of their
masters’ families.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>One reason which may be mentioned for the
good-will that continued to exist during this
crisis, and has borne its part in preserving
kindly relations ever since, is that, among the
slave-owning class, there was hardly a child
who had not been rocked in a colored mammy’s
arms and whose first ride had not been taken
with a Negro at his horse’s head; not one
whose closest playmates in youth had not been
the young Negroes of the plantation. The entire
generation which grew up during and just
after the war grew up with the young Negroes,
and preserved for them the feeling and
sympathy which their fathers had had before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
them. This feeling may hardly be explained
to those who have not known it. Those who
have known it will need no explanation. It
possibly partakes somewhat of a feudal instinct;
possibly of a clan instinct. It is not mere affection;
for it may exist where affection has perished
and even where its object is personally
detested. Whatever it is, it exists universally
with those who came of the slave-holding class
in the South, who knew in their youth the Negroes
who belonged to their family, and, no
matter what the provocation, they can no more
divest themselves of it than they can of any
other principle in their lives.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Such was the relation between the whites
and the blacks of the South when
emancipation came. It remains now to
show what changes have taken place since that
time; how these changes have come about, and
what errors have been committed in dealing
with the Race-question which still affect the two
races.</p>

<p>The dissension which has come between the
two races has either been sown since the Negro’s
emancipation or is inherent in the new
conditions that have arisen.</p>

<p>When the war closed, and the emancipation
of the Negroes became an established fact, the
first pressing necessity in the South was to secure
the means of living; for in sections where
the armies had been the country had been swept
clean, and in all sections the entire labor system
was disorganized. The internal management
of the whole South, from the general government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
of the Confederate States to the domestic
arrangement of the simplest household
among the slave-holding class, had fallen to
pieces.</p>

<p>In most instances—indeed, in all of which
the writer has any knowledge—the old masters
informed their servants that their homes were
still open to them, and that if they were willing
to remain and work, they would do all in their
power to help them. But to remain, in the first
radiant holiday of freedom, was, perhaps, more
than could be expected of human nature, and
most of the blacks went off for a time, though
later a large number of them returned.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In
a little while the country was filled with an
army of occupation, and the Negroes, moved
partly by curiosity, partly by the strangeness
of the situation, and, perhaps mainly, by the
lure of the rations which the Government immediately
began to distribute, not unnaturally
flocked to the posts of the local garrisons, leaving
the fields unworked and the crops to go to
destruction.</p>

<p>From this time began the change in the
Negroes and in the old relation between them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
and the whites; a change not great at first, and
which never became great until the Negroes
had been worked on by the ignorant or designing
class who, in one guise or another, became
their teachers and leaders. In some places
the action of military commanders had already
laid the ground for serious misunderstanding
by such orders as those which were issued in
South Carolina for putting the Negroes in possession
of what were, with some irony, termed
“abandoned lands.” The idea became widespread
that the Government was going to divide
the lands of the whites among the Negroes.
Soon all over the South the belief became current
that every Negro was to receive “forty
acres and a mule”; a belief that undoubtedly
was fostered by some of the U. S. officials. But,
in the main, the military commanders acted
with wisdom and commendable breadth of
view, and the breach was made by civilians.</p>

<p>From the first, the conduct of the North
toward the Negro was founded on the following
principles: First, that all men are equal
(whatever this may mean), and that the Negro
is the equal of the white; secondly, that he
needed to be sustained by the Government; and
thirdly, that the interests of the Negro and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
white were necessarily opposed, and the Negro
needed protection against the white.</p>

<p>The South has always maintained that these
were fundamental errors.</p>

<p>It appears to the writer that the position of
the South on these points is sound; that, however
individuals of one race may appear the
equals of individuals of the other race, the
races themselves are essentially unequal.</p>

<p>The chief trouble that arose between the two
races in the South after the war grew out of
the ignorance at the North of the actual conditions
at the South, and the ignorance at the
South of the temper and the power of the
North. The North believed that the Negro
was, or might be made, the actual equal of the
White, and that the South not only rejected
this dogma, but, further, did not accept emancipation
with sincerity, and would do all in its
power to nullify the work which had already
been accomplished, and hold the Negroes in
quasi-servitude. The South held that the Negro
was not the equal of the white, and further
held that, suddenly released from slavery,
he must, to prevent his becoming a burden
and a menace, be controlled and compelled to
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>In fact, as ignorance of each other brought
about the conditions which produced the war
between the sections, so it has brought about
most of the trouble since the war.</p>

<p>The basic difficulty in the way of reaching
a correct solution of the Negro problem is, as
has been stated, that the two sections of the
American people have hitherto looked at it
from such widely different standpoints.</p>

<p>The North, for the present far removed and
well buttressed against any serious practical consequences,
and even against temporary discomfort
from the policies and conditions it has
advocated, acting on a theory, filled with a spirit
of traditionary guardianship of the Negro, and
reasoning from limited examples of progression
and virtue, has ever insisted on one principle
and one policy, founded on a conception of the
absolute equality of the two races. The South,
in direct contact with the practical working of
every phase of the question, affected in its daily
life by every form and change that the question
takes, resolutely asserts that the conception on
which that policy is predicated is fundamentally
erroneous, and that this policy would destroy
not only the white race of the South, but even
the civilization which the race has helped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
establish, and for which it stands, and so, in
time, would inevitably debase and destroy the
nation itself.</p>

<p>Thus, the South holds that the question is
vastly more far-reaching than the North deems
it to be; that, indeed, it goes to the very foundation
of race preservation. And this contention,
so far from being a mere political tenet,
is held by the entire white population of the
South as the most passionate dogma of the
white race.</p>

<p>This confusion of definitions has in the past
resulted in untold evil, and it cannot be insisted
on too often that it is of the utmost importance
that the truth, whatever it is, should be established.
When this shall be accomplished, and
done so clearly that both sides shall accept it,
the chief difficulty in the way of complete understanding
between the sections will be removed.
So long as the two sections are divided
upon it, the question will never be settled. As
soon as they unite in one view, it will settle itself
on the only sound foundation—that of unimpeachable
economic truth.</p>

<p>To this ignorance and opposition of views on
the part of the two sections, unhappily, were
added at the outset the misunderstandings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
passions engendered by war, which prevented
reason having any great part in a work which
was to affect the whole future of the nation.
With a fixed idea that there could be no justice
toward the Negroes in any dealings of their
former masters, all matters relating to the Negroes
were intrusted by the Government to the
organization which had recently been started
for this very purpose under the name of the
Freedmen’s Bureau. It was a subject which
called for the widest knowledge and the broadest
wisdom, and, unhappily, both knowledge
and wisdom appeared to have been resolutely
banished in the treatment of the subject.</p>

<p>The basis of the institution of the Freedmen’s
Bureau was the assumption stated: that
the interests of the blacks and of the whites
were necessarily opposed to each other, and
that the blacks needed protection against the
whites in all cases. The densest ignorance of
the material on which the organization was to
work prevailed, and the personnel of the organization
was as unsuited to the work as could well
be. With a small infusion of sensible men were
mingled a considerable element of enthusiasts
who felt themselves called to be the regenerators
of the slaves and the scourge of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
former masters, and with these, a large element
of reckless adventurers who, recognizing a
field for the exercise of their peculiar talents,
went into the business for what they could make
out of it. Measures were adopted which might
have been sound enough in themselves if they
had been administered with any practical wisdom.
But there was no wisdom in the administration.
Those who advised moderation and
counselled with the whites were set aside. Bred
on the idea of slavery presented in “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” and inflamed by passions engendered
by the war, the enthusiasts honestly
believed that they were right in always taking
the side of the down-trodden Negro; while the
adventurers, gauging with an infallible appraisement
the feelings at the North, went
about their work with businesslike methods to
stir up sectional strife and reap all they could
from the abundant harvest. And of the two,
the one did about as much mischief as the
other.</p>

<p>No statement of any Southern white person,
however pure in life, lofty in morals, high-minded
in principle he might be, was accepted.
His experience, his position, his character,
counted for nothing. He was assumed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
so designing or so prejudiced that his counsel
was valueless.</p>

<p>It is a phase of the case which has not yet
wholly disappeared, and even now we have presented
to us in a large section of the country
the singular spectacle of evidence being weighed
rather by a man’s geographical position than
by his character and his opportunity for knowledge.</p>

<p>This self-complacent ignorance is one of the
factors which prevent a complete understanding
of the problem and tend to perpetuate the
errors which have cost so much in the past and,
unless corrected, may prove yet more expensive
in the future.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Freedmen’s Bureau misled
the Negroes and caused the first breach between
them and their former masters. Ignorance
and truculence characterized almost every
act of that unhappy time. Nearly every mistake
that could be made was made on both
sides. Measures that were designed with the
best intentions were so administered as to
bring these intentions to wreck.</p>

<p>On the emancipation of the slaves, the more
enlightened whites of the South saw quite as
clearly as any person at the North could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
seen the necessity of some substitute for the
former direction and training of the Negroes,
and schools were started in many places by
the old masters for the colored children.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Teachers and money had come from the
North for the education of the Negroes, and
many schools were opened. But the teachers,
at first, devoted as many of them were, by
their unwisdom alienated the good-will of the
whites and frustrated much of the good which
they might have accomplished. They might
have been regarded with distrust in any case,
for no people look with favor on the missionaries
who come to instruct them as to matters of
which they feel they know much more than the
missionaries, and the South regarded jealously
any teaching of the Negroes which looked
toward equality. The new missionaries went
counter to the deepest prejudice of the Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
people. They lived with the Negroes,
consorting with them, and appearing with them
on terms of apparent intimacy, and were believed
to teach social equality, a doctrine which
was the surest of all to arouse enmity then as
now. The result was that hostility to the public-school
system sprang up for a time. In some
sections violence was resorted to by the rougher
element, though it was of short duration, and
was always confined to a small territory.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Before
long, however, this form of opposition disappeared
and the public-school system became
an established fact.</p>

<p>The next step in the alienation of the races
was the formation of the secret order of the
Union League. The meetings were held at
night, with closed doors, and with pickets
guarding the approaches, and were generally
under the direction of the most hostile members
of the Freedmen’s Bureau. The whites
regarded this movement with serious misgivings,
as well they might, for, having as its
basic principle the consolidation of the Negro
race against the white race, it banded the Negroes
in an organization which, with the exception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
of the Confederate Army, was the most
complete that has ever been known in the
South, and the fruits of which still survive to-day.
Without going into the question of the
charges that the League taught the most inflammatory
doctrines, it may be asserted without
fear of question that its teaching was to alienate
the Negroes from the whites; to withdraw them
wholly from reliance on their former masters,
and to drill into their minds the imperative
necessity of adherence to their new leaders, and
those whom those leaders represented.</p>

<p>Then came the worst enemy that either race
had ever had: the post-bellum politician. The
problem was already sufficiently complicated
when politics were injected into it. Well might
General Lee say with a wise knowledge of men:
“The real war has just begun.”</p>

<p>No sooner had the Southern armies laid
down their guns and the great armies of the
North who had saved the Union disbanded,
than the vultures, who had been waiting in the
secure distance, gathered to the feast. The act
of a madman had removed the wisest, most
catholic, most conservative, and the ablest
leader, one whose last thoughts almost had
been to “restore the Union” by restoring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
government of the Southern States along constitutional
lines; and well the politicians used
the unhappy tragedy for their purposes. Those
who had been most cowardly in war were bravest
in peace, now that peace had come. Even
in Mr. Lincoln’s time the radical leaders in
Congress had made a strenuous fight to carry
out their views, and their hostility to his plan
of pacification and reconstruction was expressed
with hardly less vindictiveness than they exhibited
later toward his successor.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The Southern people, unhappily, acted precisely
as this element wished them to act; for
they were sore, unquelled, and angry. They
met denunciation with defiance.</p>

<p>Knowing the imperative necessities of the
time as no Northerner could know them; fearing
the effects of turning loose a slave population
of several millions, and ignorant of the
deep feeling of the Northern people; the
Southerners hastily enacted laws regulating
labor which were certainly unwise in view of
the consequences that followed, and possibly, if
enforced, might have proved oppressive, though
they never had a trial. Most of these laws
were simply reënactments of old vagrant laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
on the statute books and some still stand on
the statute books; but they were enacted
now expressly to control the Negroes; they
showed the animus of the great body of the
whites, and they aroused a deep feeling of distrust
and much resentment among the Northerners.
And, finally, they played into the
hands of the politicians who were on the lookout
for any pretext to fasten their grip on the
South.</p>

<p>The struggle just then became intensified between
the President and his opponents in
Washington, with the Presidency and the control
of the Government as the stake, and with
the South holding the balance of power; and,
unhappily, the Negroes appeared to the politicians
an element that could be utilized to advantage
by being made the “permanent allies” of
what Mr. Stevens, Mr. Wade, and Mr. Sumner
used to term “the party of the Union.”</p>

<p>So, the Negro appeared to the politicians a
useful instrument, and to the doctrinaires “a
man and brother” who was the equal of his
former master, and, if he were “armed with
the weapon” of the ballot, would be able to
protect himself and would inevitably rise to the
full stature of the white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>A large part of the people of the North were
undoubtedly inspired by a missionary spirit
which had a high motive beneath it. But a
missionary spirit undirected by knowledge of
real conditions is a dangerous guide to follow.
And the danger was never better illustrated
than in this revolution. Doubtless, some
of the politicians were inspired partly by the
same idea; but the major portion had but one
ruling passion—the securing of power and the
down-treading of the Southern whites.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Then came the crowning error: the practical
carrying out of the theories by infusing into
the body politic a whole race just emerging
from slavery. The most intelligent and conservative
class of the whites were disfranchised;
the entire adult Negro population were
enfranchised.</p>

<p>It is useless to discuss the motives with which
this was done. No matter what the motives
it was a national blunder; in its way as great
a blunder as secession.</p>

<p>It is not uncommonly supposed that Mr. Lincoln
was the originator of this idea. The weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of his name is frequently given to it by the uninformed.
Mr. Lincoln, however, was too
level-headed and clear-sighted a statesman ever
to have committed so great a folly. The
furthest he ever went was in his letter to Governor
Hahn, of Louisiana, in which he “suggested”
the experiment of intrusting the ballot
to “some of the colored people, for instance
... the very intelligent,” and as a reward
for those who had fought for the Union.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In fact, for a year or two after the war no
one in authority dreamed of investing the Negro
race at once with the elective franchise.
This came after the South had refused to tolerate
the idea of the franchise being conferred
on any of them, and after passions had become
inflamed.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The eight years of Reconstruction possibly
cost the South more than the four years of war
had cost her. To state it in mere figures, it
may be said that when the eight years of Negro
domination under carpet-bag leaders had
passed, the public indebtedness of the Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
States had increased about fourfold, while the
property values in all the States had shrunk,
and in those States which were under the Negro
rule had fallen to less than half what they
had been when the South entered on that period.
In Louisiana, for instance, the cost of
Negro rule for four years and five months
amounted to $106,020,337, besides the privileges
and franchises given away to those having
“pulls,” and State franchises stolen. The
wealth of New Orleans shrank during these
eight years from $146,718,790 to $88,613,930,
while real estate values in the country parishes
shrank from $99,266,083 to $47,141,699.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In South Carolina and Mississippi, the other
two States which were wholly under Negro
rule, the condition was, if anything, worse than
in Louisiana, while in the other Southern States
it was not so bad, though bad enough.</p>

<p>But the presentation of the statistics gives
little idea of what the people of the South
underwent while their State Governments were
controlled by Negroes.</p>

<p>A wild Southern politician is said to have
once truculently boasted that he would call the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
roll of his slaves at the foot of the Bunker Hill
Monument. If the tradition is true, it was a
piece of insolence which naturally offended
deeply the sentiment of the people of the proud
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. But this
was mere gasconade. Had he been able to
carry out his threat, and then had he installed
his Negroes in the State-house of Massachusetts,
and, by travesty of law, filled the legislative
halls with thieves and proceeded to disfranchise
the best and the proudest people of the Commonwealth;
then had he, sustained by bayonets,
during eight years ridden rough-shod over
them; cut the value of their property in half;
quadrupled their taxes; sold out over twenty
per cent. of the landed property of the State
for forfeiture; appointed over two hundred
Negro trial justices who could neither read nor
write, put a Negro on the bench of their highest
court, and paraded through the State something
like 80,000 Negro militia, armed with
money stolen from the State, to insult and menace
the people, while the whole South looked
coolly on and declared that this treatment was
just; then might there be a partial but not a
complete parallel to what some of the States
of the South endured under Negro rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>It is little wonder that Governor Chamberlain,
Republican and carpet-bagger though he
was, should have declared as he did in writing
to the New England Society: “The civilization
of the Puritan and Cavalier, of the Roundhead
and Huguenot, is in peril.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The South does not hold that the Negro race
was primarily responsible for this travesty of
government. Few reasonable men now charge
the Negroes at large with more than ignorance
and an invincible faculty for being worked on.
But the consequences were none the less disastrous.</p>

<p>The injury to the whites was not the only
injury caused by the reconstruction system. To
the Negroes, the objects of its bounty, it was
no less a calamity.</p>

<p>However high the motive may have been,
no greater error could have been committed;
nothing could have been more disastrous to the
Negro’s future than the teaching he thus received.
He was taught that the white man was
his enemy when he should have been taught to
cultivate his friendship. He was told he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
equal of the white when he was not the equal;
he was given to understand that he was the
ward of the nation when he should have been
trained in self-reliance; he was led to believe
that the Government would sustain him when
he could not be sustained. In legislation, he
was taught thieving; in politics, he was taught
not to think for himself, but to follow slavishly
his leaders (and such leaders!); in private
life, he was taught insolence. A laborer,
dependent on his labor, no greater misfortune
could have befallen him than estrangement
from the Southern whites. To instil into his
mind the belief that the Southern white was
his enemy; that his interest was necessarily
opposed to that of the white, and that he must
thwart the white man to the utmost of his
power, was to deprive him of his best friend
and to array against him his strongest enemy.</p>

<p>To the teachings which led the Negro to feel
that he was “the ward of the nation”; that he
was a peculiar people whom the nation had
taken under its wing and would support and
foster; and that he could, by its fiat, be made
the equal of the white, and would, by its strong
arm, be sustained as such, may, perhaps, be
traced most of the misfortunes of the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
race, and, indeed, of the whole South, since
the war. The Negro saw the experiment being
tried; he saw his former master, who had
been to him the type of all that was powerful
and proud, and brave, and masterful, put down
and held down by the United States Government,
while he, himself, was set up and declared
his full equal. He is quick to learn, and
during this period, when he was sustained by
the Government, he was as insolent as he dared
to be. The only check on him was his lurking
recognition of the Southerner’s dominant force.</p>

<p>The one thing that saved the Southerners
was that they knew it was not the Negroes but
the Federal Government that held them in subjection.</p>

<p>The day the bayonets were withdrawn from
the South, the Negro power, which but the day
before had been as arrogant and insolent as
ever in the whole course of its brief authority,
fell to pieces.</p>

<p>It is little less than amazing that the whites
of the South should, after all that they went
through during the period of reconstruction,
have retained their kindly feeling for the Negroes,
and not only retained but increased their
loyalty to the Union. To the writer, it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
one of the highest tributes to the white people
of the South that their patriotism should
have remained so strong after all they had
endured.</p>

<p>The explanation is that the hostility of the
Southern people was not directed so much
against the United States or its Government,
to form which they had contributed so much
and in which they had taken so much pride, as
against that element among the people of the
North that had always opposed them, particularly
where slavery was concerned. In seceding,
the Southerners had acted on the doctrine
enunciated by so distinguished a Northerner as
John Quincy Adams in 1839, when he declared
that it would be better for the States to “part
in friendship from each other than to be held
together by constraint,” and look forward “to
form again a more perfect friendship by dissolving
that which could not bind, and to leave
the separated parts to be reunited by the law
of political gravitation to the centre,”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
now, slavery and secession having finally been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
disposed of, they naturally and necessarily
gravitated back to the old feeling for the
Union.</p>

<p>It is not less remarkable that, notwithstanding
all the humiliation they had to endure during
the period of Negro domination, they
should still have retained their feeling of kindliness
for the race. The fact, however, was
that they did not charge against the race in
general the enormities which were committed
by them during that period. However they
might be outraged by their insolence and their
acts, they charged it rather against the leaders
than against the followers. The Southerners
knew the Negroes; knew their weaknesses and
their merits, and knew how easily they were
misled. And it was always significant that
though the Negroes universally followed their
leaders and, when they felt themselves in
power, conducted themselves with intolerable
insolence, at other times they exhibited their old
kindliness, and no sooner was the instigation
removed than they were ready to resume their
old relation of dependence and affection.</p>

<p>Indeed, those who had been the worst and
most revolutionary had no sooner sunk back
into their former position of civility than they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
were forgiven and treated with good-natured
tolerance.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>With the overthrow of the carpet-bag governments,
and the destruction of Negro domination
at the South, the South began to shoot
up into the light of a new prosperity. Burdened
as she was by debt; staggering under disasters
that had well-nigh destroyed her; scarred
by the struggle through which she had gone,
and scorched by the passions of that fearful
time, she set herself with all her energies to
recovering through the arts of peace her old
place in the path of progress. The burden she
has borne has been heavy, but she has carried it
bravely and triumphantly.</p>

<p>Her property values have steadily increased.
Mills have been started and manufactories established,
and this not only by Southern investors,
but, to a considerable extent, by Northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
capital, until the South has become one of the
recognized fields for investment. This, among
other causes, has made the South restive under
an electorate which has confined her to one
political party, shut her off from ability to divide
on economic questions, and which, to a
certain extent, withdrew her from her due participation
in the National Government. With
this, another cause is the change of the relation
between the two races. It is useless to blink
the question. The old relation of intimacy and
affection that survived to a considerable extent
even the strain and stress of the reconstruction
period, and the repressive measures that followed
it, has passed away, and in its place has
come a feeling of indifference or contempt on
the one side, and indifference or envy on the
other. In some places, under some conditions,
the old attitude of reliance and the old feeling
of affection still remain. For example, in
many families, the old relation of master and
servant, of superior and retainer, may still exist.
In some neighborhoods or towns, individuals
of the colored race, by their ability and
character, have achieved a position which has
brought to them the respect and sincere good-will
of the whites. A visit to the South will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
show anyone that, in the main, the feeling of
kindness and good-will has survived all the
haranguing of the politician and all the teaching
of the doctrinaire. Ordinarily, the children
still play together, the men work together, the
elders still preserve their old good-will. The
whites visit the sick and afflicted, help the
unfortunate, relieve the distressed, console the
bereaved, and perform the old offices of kindness.
But this is, to some extent, exceptional.
It is mainly confined to the very young, the
old, or the unfortunate and dependent. The
rule is a changed relation and a widening
breach. The teaching of the younger generation
of Negroes is to be rude and insolent. In
the main, it is only where the whites have an
undisputed authority that the old relation survives.
Where the whites are so superior in
numbers that no question can be raised; or
again, where, notwithstanding the reversed conditions,
the whites are in a position so dominant
as not to admit of question, harmony
prevails.</p>

<p>When the relations are reversed there is
danger of an outbreak. The Negro, misled by
the teaching of his doctrinaire friends into
thinking himself the equal of the white, asserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
himself, and the white resents it. The consequence
is a clash, and the Negro becomes the
chief sufferer so invariably that it ought to
throw some light on the doctrine of equality.</p>

<span class="fs80">ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND ASPECT, AS<br>
SHOWN BY STATISTICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Having in the two previous papers
undertaken to show the relation between
the whites of the South and
the Negroes at the time of the abolition of slavery,
and having traced the change in that relation
and pointed out the mistakes which, in
the writer’s opinion, were mainly responsible
for whatever trouble has since arisen between
them, it now remains to see what the present
condition is; how far it is attributable to those
causes, and what promise the future holds of
amendment.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight years have passed since the Negro
was set free and became his own master.
By sentimentalists and Negro writers and orators,
most of the Negro’s shortcomings are usually
charged to slavery, and undoubtedly slavery
leaves certain traits which the student can
readily detect. But most of the class of writers
referred to ignore the fact that the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
at the close of slavery was in a higher condition
of civilization than when he came a savage
from the wilds of Africa. Of slavery it
may be said that it was the greatest evil that
ever befell this country. It kept the sections
divided and finally plunged the nation into a
devastating civil war. This is indictment
enough. But to the Negro it was far from an
unmixed evil. This very period of slavery in
America had given to him the only semblance
of civilization which the Negro race has possessed
since the dawn of history.</p>

<p>Whatever evils slavery may have entailed
upon the Negro, this much may unquestionably
be predicted of it: it left him a trained laborer
and in good physical condition. He started in
on a new era with a large share of friendliness
on the part of the South and with the enthusiastic
good-will of the North. He had little
property, and not more than two or three per
cent. were able to read; but he commanded the
entire field of labor in the South, while a certain
percentage, composed of house-servants,
had the knowledge which comes from holding
positions of responsibility and from constant
association with educated people.</p>

<p>When the war closed, among the four millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
of Negroes who then inhabited the South,
there was, with the exception of the invalids,
the cripples, and the superannuated, scarcely an
adult who was not a trained laborer or a skilled
artisan. In the cotton section they knew how
to raise and prepare cotton; in the sugar
belt they knew how to grow and grind sugar;
in the tobacco, corn, wheat, and hay belts they
knew how to raise and prepare for market those
crops. They were the shepherds, cattle-men,
horse-trainers and raisers. The entire industrial
work of the South was performed by them.
They were the trained domestic servants—laundresses,
nurses, and midwives. They were the
carpenters, smiths, coopers, sawyers, wheelwrights,
bricklayers, and boatmen. They were
the tanners and shoemakers, miners and stonecutters,
tailors and knitters, spinners and weavers.
Nearly all the houses in the South were
built by them. They manufactured most of
the articles that were manufactured in the
South.</p>

<p>No exact statistics of the race at that time
may be obtained, but a reasonably approximate
estimate may be made, based on the known
facts, as to the number of slave-holders, and
the general relation of house-servants, mechanics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
etc., to the entire population. It is known,
for instance, that the slave-holder, whether he
owned few or many, invariably had his best
slaves as domestic servants. It is equally well
known that the large plantations hired the services
of those on the larger estates.</p>

<p>In 1860 there were in the Southern States
between five and six hundred thousand slave-owners
and slave hirers, and there were four
million and a quarter slaves, or about eight
slaves to each owner.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Of these slave-owners,
perhaps, every one had at least one house-servant,
and most of them had several. Striking
a mean between the smaller slave-owner and
the larger, it would probably be found that the
proportion of mechanics and artisans to the entire
population was about the same that it is in
any agricultural community, or, as the slave is
known to be generally not as industrious and
efficient as the free workman, the percentage
was possibly higher than it is to-day in the West
or in the agricultural parts of the South. It is
not pretended that this is more than a conjecture,
but it is a conjecture based upon what
appears a conservative estimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Since that time, according to the census of
1900, over $109,000,000 had been expended
by the South on the Negro’s education, besides
what has been expended by private charity,
which is estimated to amount to $30,000,000.</p>

<p>The South has faithfully applied itself during
all these years to giving the Negroes all the
opportunities possible for attaining an education,
and it is one of the most creditable pages
in her history that in face of the horror of Negro-domination
during the Reconstruction period;
of the disappointment at the small results;
in face of the fact that the education of
the Negroes has appeared to be used by them
only as a weapon with which to oppose the
white race, the latter should have persistently
given so largely of its store to provide this
misused education. Of the $109,000,000
which the Southern States have, since the
war, applied to the education of the Negro by
voluntary taxation, over $100,000,000 was
raised by the votes of the whites from taxation
on the property of the whites. Several times
of late years propositions have been made in
various legislatures in the South to devote the
money raised by taxation of the property of
each race exclusively to the education of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
race, but in every case, to their credit be it said,
the propositions have been overwhelmingly defeated.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The total expenditure for public
schools in the South in the year 1898-1899 was
$32,849,892, of which $6,569,978 was to sustain
Negro schools.</p>

<p>Inspection of the records will reveal something
of the fruits of the $140,000,000 expended
on the education of the Negroes at the
South, and the rest must be learned from those
who have studied the subject at first hand.</p>

<p>It seems to the writer that one of the fundamental
errors which have inhered in all the discussion
which has taken place on the Negro
question is in considering the Negroes as absolutely
of one class. A brief consideration of the
matter will show on the contrary that the colored
population of the South, though they were,
with the exception of a few Arabs, all of Negro
blood, were, when they came to this country, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
different tribes; and there were, even during the
time of slavery, and are yet more markedly now,
grades among them: grades of intellect, of character,
and of ability, which point to, if not varying
racial, at least varying tribal forces. And
however they may all appear to herd together
and look at most matters not from an individual
and rational, but from a racial standpoint, a
careful study will disclose certain distinctions
which have the mark of tribal distinctions, while
others will show the elements of class distinctions.
These class distinctions, though still elementary,
are beginning to make themselves
apparent.</p>

<p>The line of cleavage unhappily does not follow
that of conduct or good manners, much less
that of character, but, perhaps, it may approximate
them more closely in time, and the upper
class will learn and cause it to be understood
that conduct, character, and good manners are
the key to admission.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the writer in this discussion
to recognize this distinction, and, when
he speaks of “the Negroes,” he desires generally
to be understood as referring to the great
body of the race, and not as including what may
be termed the upper fraction—that is, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
who, by reason of intellect, education, and character,
form so clearly an exception that they
must be considered as a separate class.</p>

<p>The Negroes, indeed, may be divided into
three classes.</p>

<p>The first is a small class, comparatively
speaking, who are more or less educated, some
being well educated and well conducted; others,
with a semblance of education and none too
well behaved. The former constitute what may
be termed the upper fraction; the latter possess
only a counterfeit culture and lack the essential
elements of character and even moral perception.</p>

<p>The second class is composed of a respectable,
well-behaved, self-respecting element; sensible,
though with little or no education, and,
except when under the domination of passion,
good citizens. This class embraces most of
the more intelligent of the older generation who
were trained in slavery, and a considerable element
of the intelligent middle-aged, conservative
workers of the race who were trained by
that generation. The two together may be
called the backbone of the race.</p>

<p>The third class is composed of those who are
wholly ignorant, or in whom, though they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
what they call education, this so-called education
is unaccompanied by any of the fruits of
character which education is supposed to produce.
Among these are many who esteem
themselves in the first class, and, because of a
veneer of education, are not infrequently confounded
with them.</p>

<p>The first two classes may easily be reckoned
with. They contain the elements which make
good citizens and which should enable them to
secure all proper recognition and respect. They
need no weapon but that which they possess—good
citizenship.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the great body of the race,
and a vast percentage of the growing generation,
belong to the third class. It is this class
which has to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>It is like a vast sluggish mass of uncooled
lava over a large section of the country, burying
some portions and affecting the whole. It
is apparently harmless, but beneath its surface
smoulder fires which may at any time burst forth
unexpectedly and spread desolation all around.
It is this mass, increasing from beneath, not
from above, which constitutes the Negro question.</p>

<p>In the discussion that takes place in the periodical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
press and in conventions relating to the
progress of the colored race, a great deal is
made of the advance of the race since the abolition
of slavery. It is asserted that the race has
accumulated many hundreds of millions of dollars.
Just how much, it is difficult to say. Authorities
differ widely. The last Negro member
of Congress,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in a speech delivered in the
House of Representatives on January 29, 1901,
undertook to give the advance of his race in the
thirty-two preceding years. “Since that time,”
he says, “we have reduced the illiteracy of the
race at least 45 per cent. We have written and
published nearly 500 books. We have nearly
300 newspapers, three of which are dailies. We
have now in practice over 2,000 lawyers and a
corresponding number of doctors. We have
accumulated over $12,000,000 worth of school
property and about $40,000,000 of church
property. We have about 140,000 farms and
homes valued at in the neighborhood of $750,000,000,
and personal property valued at about
$170,000,000.... We have 32,000 teachers
in the schools of the country. We have
built, with the aid of our friends, about 20,000
churches, and support 7 colleges, 17 academies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
50 high schools, 5 law schools, 5 medical
schools, and 25 theological seminaries. We
have over 600,000 acres of land in the South
alone.”</p>

<p>It might be assumed that, as he was glorifying
his race, this is the outside estimate of what
they have accomplished, had not other colored
leaders and teachers since that time asserted that
these figures are far too low. To the writer
these estimates would appear grossly exaggerated.
Certainly the educational achievement of
which they boast cannot justly be attributed, in
the main, to the Negro race. The white race
furnished 95 per cent. of the money for the
schools, and a yet larger proportion for the
colleges.</p>

<p>It is stated that “before the war the South
had a free Negro population in excess of a
quarter of a million souls,” and, according to
an estimate which has been made by one of the
distinguished members of the race, the value of
property owned by free Negroes was between
$35,000,000 and $40,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Although the
exact amount must be based somewhat on conjecture,
it is certain that there were a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
number of free Negroes in the country at
that time who owned considerable property.
Some of those in the South were land-owners
and slave-owners, while of the 226,216 who
lived outside of the slave States, a fair proportion
were well-to-do. According to the report
of a Commission appointed by Mr. Lincoln in
1863 to “examine and report upon the condition
of the newly emancipated Freedmen of the
United States,” the Commission ascertained
that the free colored people of Louisiana in the
year 1860 paid taxes on an assessment of thirteen
millions.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> To this sum must be added the
amount that was accumulated during the Reconstruction
period, by other means than those of
honest thrift. The residue marks the advance
of the Negro race in material progress.</p>

<p>Unhappily for those who claim that the Negro
race has shown extraordinary thrift since
its emancipation thirty-eight years ago, the records,
when examined, fail to bear out the contention.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June, 1903, Mr. Charles A.
Gardiner, of the New York bar, delivered a
notable address at Albany, before the Convocation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
of the University of the State of New York,
on a “Constitutional and Educational Solution
of the Negro Problem,” in which he presented
some remarkable statements relating to the condition
of the Negroes. He showed that, in
1890, the real and personal property of the
fifteen old slave States was $13,380,517,311,
of which the blacks owned only 3.3 per cent.,
an average of $64.20 per capita. The six Atlantic
and Gulf States had $3,215,127,929, of
which the blacks owned only 3.5 per cent., an
average of $28.60 each. The writer has tried
to obtain the later statistics, but has not been
successful in securing complete statistics, owing
to the fact that the United States Census Bureau
has not yet completed its calculations
touching this subject, and because many of the
States do not keep separately the records of the
property owned by the whites and Negroes.
He has, however, secured from the records of
the States of Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina,
and Virginia, where the records are kept
separately, the statistics showing the actual and
relative amount of property owned by the
Negroes for the year 1902:</p>

<p>It is possible that the States of Arkansas,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia may be
considered quite representative of the entire
South. The Negroes are believed to be as well
off in these States as in any others. The four
States contain 2,686,859 Negroes, which is
30.39 per cent. of the entire Negro population
of the whole United States, and the statistics
show that this 30.39 per cent. of the entire Negro
population own now, in real and personal
property listed for taxation, only $53,797,845,
which is but $20.02 per capita. The assessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>

be stated to be generally, at least, three-quarters
of the actual value.</p>

<p>“These figures show that the slaves formed
about one-third of the total population of that
section, but that the owners of these slaves
formed only between 5 and 6 per cent. of the
white population and between 3 and 4 per cent.
of the total population, the proportion being
even lower in 1860 than in 1850.</p>

<p>“In 1900 there were 187,799 farms owned
by Negroes, which was 25.2 per cent. of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
farms operated by Negroes. In 1900 Negro
farmers who owned all of the land they cultivated
formed 83.3 per cent. of all Negro
owners.</p>

<p>“If an estimate of the probable total farm
wealth of the Negro farmers, June 1, 1900, be
desired, the value of the live stock on rented
farms, of which a large share generally belongs
to the tenants, should be added. That value for
the colored tenants was $57,167,206. Adding
this sum to the preceding total, it appears the
value, June 1, 1900, of the farm property belonging
to Negroes was approximately $200,000,000,
or a little less than $300 for each
Negro farmer.</p>

<p>“This estimate, however, takes no account
of property owned by Negroes and rented out
to either Negroes or whites.... Therefore,
we are probably justified in adding 15 per cent.
to the above estimated value of property owned

thus bringing the total up to $230,000,000.</p>

<p>“The value of the land in farms of all colored

<p>Georgia has been not infrequently cited as a State in which
the Negro has thriven somewhat exceptionally. It contains
more Negroes than does any other State, having, by the
census of 1900, 1,034,813 Negroes. In 1860 it contained
465,698, so that the Negroes have since that time increased
there at the rate of 142,279 every ten years. The Bulletin
of the Department of Labor, No. 35, July 1901, contains a
valuable paper by Prof. Du Bois on the Negro landholder
in Georgia, based on a close study of the conditions of the
Negro in that State. Among other matters he gives a table
containing the assessed value of all property owned by
Negroes in Georgia from 1874 to 1900:</p>

<p>From this table it will be found that the taxable values of
all the property owned by Negroes in Georgia in the year
1874 were $6,157,798. In 1890 the Negro population was
858,815. In 1892 the property valuation has risen to $14,869,575,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and in 1900, when the population was 1,034,813,
it was only $14,118,720, or an actual falling off, though the
Negroes appear to have increased 23.9 per cent. in this
time.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such is the showing of statistics as to the
advance marked by the accumulation of property.
It fails to bear out the claim that the
Negro race has shown remarkable progress
along this line. It must be further observed
that in reporting the property holdings no account
is taken of the mortgages and other indebtedness
of the property owners.</p>

<p>But under this economic presentation lies a
deeper question. What have the thousands of
churches and schools and colleges, maintained
at the cost of more than a hundred and fifty
million dollars, produced? What kind of men
and women have they turned out? What fruits
have they brought forth, of moral stamina; of
character; of purity of life; of loftiness or even
correctness of ideals? These are the true tests
of progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>To reach a correct answer to these questions,
we may inquire first: Has the percentage of
crime decreased in the race generally? Has the
wage-earning capacity of the race generally increased
in proportion to the rise of wages?
Has the race generally improved, morally and
mentally? Is the relative position of the race
to that of the white race higher than it was?</p>

<p>Unquestionably, a certain proportion of the
Negro race has risen notably since the era of
emancipation. A proportion of the colored
population—that is, the upper fraction—have
not only accumulated property but have, mainly
in the cities and towns, attained a higher standing,
based partly on property, partly on character,
and partly on intellectual advance. But,
unless the universal testimony of the white people
of the South is unreliable, this rise is confined
largely to those regions where the Negroes
have had the aid, sympathy, and encouragement
of the whites. And it appears to the writer that
this element is not as large as is generally assumed,
and that this very advance has separated
them all the more widely from the great body
of the colored race. Study of the question,
moreover, discloses the fact that almost all
of the intellectual advance in the Negro race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
is confined to this upper fraction of the race;
that, perhaps, nine-tenths of the property accumulated
has been accumulated by this class and
by the other fraction which belongs to the second
class who were trained in slavery, and that,
measured by the ordinary standards of character,
intellect, and civic standing, the other
nine-tenths of the race, so far from advancing
in any way, have either stood stagnant or have
retrograded.</p>

<p>According to the United States Census of
1890, the native white criminals in the United
States numbered 40,471; the native whites
whose parents were also native-born numbered
21,037; the Negro criminals (whose parents
were native) numbered 24,277.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>A comparison of the rural colored population
will show that possibly over ninety per cent. of
the property now owned by the Negroes has
been accumulated by those who were either
trained in slavery or grew up immediately after
the war, so that they received the beneficial effects
of the habits of industry in which their
race was at that time trained. It will show in
the next place that the proportion of convicts in
the State penitentiaries in the Southern States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
from the Negroes is from 85 to 93 per cent. of
the total number of convicts confined. In Louisiana
the proportion is 85 per cent. of all State
criminals. In Alabama it is 85.4 per cent. In
Florida, 86.4 per cent. In Mississippi it is 91
per cent. In Georgia it is 90 per cent., and in
South Carolina it is 93.2 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In the
District of Columbia, where the Negroes are
assumed to have had exceptional advantages and
where possibly a certain element of them are as
well off as anywhere in the country, they furnished,
a year or two ago, 86 per cent. of the
criminals. Of these convicts, more than nine-tenths
have grown up since slavery was
abolished.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Negro has retrograded as a
workman until he has not only lost the field in
which he once had no rival, but is in danger
of losing even the ability to compete for its recovery.
The superiority of the older farmhands
to the younger generation is so universally
asserted throughout the South that it must
be given some of the validity of general reputation.
And whereas, as has been shown, a generation
ago all the mechanical work of the
South was in the hands of the Negroes, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a small proportion of it is done by them
to-day.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago one of the suburbs of
Richmond was largely built up by a contractor
whose foreman was a Negro. There was no
question raised about it. The foreman knew
his business; had been raised among the whites;
knew how to get along with white men, and
was respected and esteemed by them. This was
at that time not uncommon.</p>

<p>What is the situation now? The races are
more widely divided than ever before. White
mechanics and Negro mechanics no longer work
together, generally, as of old. No contractor
could do now what the man who built “Barton
Heights” did fifteen years ago. The number
of Negro carpenters and mechanics is greatly
reduced; and the writer is informed by intelligent
Negroes that such work as they do is
mainly among their own people. The causes
are not far to seek. It is partly due to a failure
of ability in the Negro to hold his place
in the struggle of competition, and partly to
the changed relations between him and the
white. The old feeling of friendliness and amity
has waned, and in its room has come a cold
indifference, if not actual hostility. The new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Negro has been taught that he is the equal of
the white, and he is always asserting it and
trying to prove it by any way but the right way—the
equality of his work.</p>

<p>Washington City has ever since the time of
emancipation appeared a sort of Mecca to many
of the Negro race. There, numbers of that
race have had opportunities which have been
wanting to them in the South, and there to-day
may be found, perhaps, the best educated element
of the race to be found anywhere. Within
the last year the Negro organization known as
the True Reformers built in that city a handsome
and expensive structure for the use of
their race, and built it wholly with Negro labor.
When, however, the workmen competent to do
such work were sought, it was found necessary
to go to the South for them.</p>

<p>Yet even in the South the Negro artisan sufficiently
trained to compete now with his white
rival is comparatively rare.</p>

<p>“The slave-disciplined mechanic has no successor
in the ranks of the freedmen....”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>So far, then, as statistics would indicate, the
improvement that exists among the Negroes is
not shown by the race at large as is usually alleged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
but is shown, in the main, by the upper
fraction.</p>

<p>This proposition is borne out also by the testimony
of the great majority of the Southern
whites who live in constant touch with the
blacks; who have known them in every relation
of life in a way that no one who has not lived
among them can know them. Universally, they
will tell you that while the old-time Negroes
were industrious, saving, and, when not misled,
well-behaved, kindly, respectful, and self-respecting,
and while the remnant of them who
remain still retain generally these characteristics,
the “new issue,” for the most part, are
lazy, thriftless, intemperate, insolent, dishonest,
and without the most rudimentary elements of
morality.</p>

<p>They unite further in the opinion that education
such as they receive in the public schools,
so far from appearing to uplift them, appears
to be without any appreciable beneficial effect
upon their morals or their standing as citizens.
But more than this; universally, they report a
general depravity and retrogression of the Negroes
at large in sections in which they are left
to themselves, closely resembling a reversion to
barbarism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that progress, as applied
to a class or a race, signifies some advance
in moral standing, or, at least, some improvement
in the elements of character on which morality
is based.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the statistics in the field
of morality cannot be obtained; but in this field,
as in others, the testimony of those who have
had the best opportunities for observation is
all one way. Southerners of every class and
calling, without exception, bear witness to the
depressing fact that, leaving out the small upper
fraction, the Negro race has not advanced
at all in morality.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the fountain is tainted at the
source. The great body of the race have
scarcely any notion of the foundation principles
of pure family life. They appear not only to
have no idea of morality, but to lack any instinct
upon which such an idea can be founded.
It is usually charged that slavery was responsible
for the absence of morality throughout the
race. Some of the Negro writers even speak
of “the ancient African chastity” having been
debauched by slavery. Doubtless, during slavery
there was a sufficient amount of immorality
to be the basis for almost any reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
charge, yet study of the question has convinced
at least one investigator that the illicit relations
between the two races during the period of slavery
have probably been greatly exaggerated.
He has come to believe further that while illicit
intercourse between the two races is less and,
perhaps, markedly less now than it was during
the period of slavery, the immorality of the
great body of the Negro race has increased since
that time. That this immorality exists is the
testimony not only of the whites, but also of
members of the race who have, with an open
mind, made a study of the conditions of their
people. Perhaps the most remarkable study of
the Negro which has appeared is the book entitled,
“The American Negro,” by William
Hannibal Thomas, of Massachusetts. No inconsiderable
part of its value is owing to the
fact that the author, a free colored man, has had
both the power to observe closely and the courage
to record boldly the results of his observations.
In the chapter on “Moral Lapses,” the
author says: “All who know the Negro recognize,
however, that the chief and overpowering
element in his make-up is an imperious sexual
impulse which, aroused at the slightest incentive,
sweeps aside all restraints in the pursuit of physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
gratification. We may say now that this
element of Negro character constitutes the
main incitement to degeneracy of the race
and is the chief hindrance to its social uplifting....</p>

<p>“The Negro’s ethical code sternly reprobates
dancing, theatre attendance, and all social
games of chance. It does not, however, forbid
lying, rum-drinking, or stealing. Furthermore,
a man may trail his loathsome form into the
sanctity of private homes, seduce a wife, sister,
or daughter with impunity, and be the father
of a score of illegitimate children by as many
mothers, and yet be a disciple of holiness and
honored with public confidence.”</p>

<p>His chapter on this subject will be, to those
unfamiliar with it, a terrible exposure of the
depravity of the Negroes in their social life,
but it is only what those who have studied the
subject know.</p>

<p>The curse of this frightful immorality is over
the church and the school, and gives no evidence
of abatement.</p>

<p>“The simple truth,” admits the writer already
quoted, “is that there is going on side
by side in the Negro people a minimum progress
with a maximum regress.” “It is, therefore,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
he says,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> “almost impossible to find a
person of either sex over fifteen years of age
who has not had carnal intercourse.” And
again,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he declares: “Marital immoralities,
however, are not confined to the poor, the ignorant,
and the degraded among the freed people,
but are equally common among those who presume
to be educated and refined.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the race, this depressing
view is borne out by the increase of crime
among them; by the increase of superstition,
with its black trail of unnamable immorality
and vice; by the homicides and murders, and by
the outbreak and growth of the brutal crime
which has chiefly brought about the frightful
crime of lynching which stains the good name
of the South and has spread northward with
the spread of the Negro ravisher.</p>

<p>It is a fact, which no one will deny, that the
crime of rape was substantially unknown during
the period of slavery, and was hardly known
during the first years of freedom: it is the fatal
product of new conditions. Twenty-five years
ago women in the South went unattended, with
no more fear of attack than they have in New
England. To-day, no woman in the South goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
alone upon the highway out of sight of white
men, except on necessity, and no man leaves his
women alone in his house if he can help it.
Over 500 white women and children have been
assaulted in the South by Negroes within that
time.</p>

<p>This is a terrible showing, and the most depressing
part of it is the failure of the Negroes
generally to address themselves to the moral
improvement of their race.</p>

<p>None of this will affect the views of the politician
or the doctrinaire, but it should, at least,
give food for thought among the rest of our
people, that these views are held almost universally
by the intelligent white people of the
South, irrespective of their different political or
religious views; irrespective of their social or
their business standing; and further, that, substantially,
these views are held by nearly all outsiders
who go and see enough of the South to
secure opportunities for close and general observation;
and, precisely as their experience is
broad and their means of information extensive,
their views approximate those held by the white
residents.</p>

race from which come most of the malefactors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
To say that Negroes furnish most of the ravishers
is not to say that all Negroes are rapists.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The crime of lynching in this country has, at
one time or another, become so frequent that it
has aroused the interest of the whole people,
and has even arrested the attention of people in
other countries. It has usually been caused by
the boldness with which crime was committed
and the inefficiency of the law in dealing
with lawbreakers through its regular forms.
Such, for instance, were the acts of the Vigilantes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
in California in the old days, and such
have been the acts of the Vigilantes in other
sections of the country at times. In these cases,
there has always been a form of trial, which,
however hasty, was conclusive on the essential
points of the commission of the crime, the identification
of the prisoner, the sentence of “Judge
Lynch”—that is, of the mob—and the orderly
execution of that sentence. And, in such cases,
most persons who are well-informed as to all
the conditions and circumstances have found
some justification for this “wild justice.”</p>

<p>Lynching, however, has never before been
so common, nor has it existed over so extended
a region as of late years in the Southern States.
And it has aroused more feeling outside of that
section than was aroused formerly by the work
of the Vigilantes. This feeling has undoubtedly
been due mainly to the belief that the lynching
has been directed almost exclusively against
the Negroes; though a part has, perhaps, come
from the supposition that the laws were entirely
effective, and that, consequently, the lynching
of Negroes has been the result of irrational hostility
or of wanton cruelty. Thus, the matter
is, to some extent, complicated by a latent idea
that it has a political complexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>This is the chief ground of complaint in the
utterances of the Negroes themselves and also
in those of a considerable part of the outside
press. And, indeed, for a good while, the lynching
of Negroes appeared to be confined to the
South, though lynching of whites was by no
means the monopoly of that section, as may be
recalled by those familiar with the history of
Indiana and some of the other Northwestern
States.</p>

<p>Of late, however, several revolting instances
of lynching of Negroes in its most dreadful
form: burning at the stake, have occurred in
regions where hitherto such forms of barbarous
punishment have been unknown; and the
time appears to be ripe for some efficient concert
of action, to eradicate what is recognized
by cool heads as a blot on our good name and
a serious menace to our civilization.</p>

<p>In discussing the means to put an end to this
barbarity, the first essential is that the matter
shall be clearly and thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>The ignorance shown by much of the discussion
that has grown out of these lynchings
would appear to justify plain speaking.</p>

<p>All thoughtful men know that respect for
law is the basic principle of civilization, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
are agreed as to the evil of any overriding of
the law. All reasonable men know that the
overriding of law readily creates a spirit of
lawlessness, under which progress is retarded
and civilization suffers and dwindles. This is
as clearly recognized at the South as at the
North. To overcome this conviction and stir
up rational men to a pitch where the law is
trampled under foot, the officers of the law are
attacked, and their prisoners taken from them
and executed, there must be some imperative
cause.</p>

<p>And yet the record of such overriding of law
in the past has been a terrible one.</p>

<p>The <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite> has for some time been
collecting statistics on the subject of lynching,
and the following table taken from that paper,
showing the number of lynchings for a series of
years, is assumed to be fairly accurate:</p>

<p>From these tables certain facts may be deduced.
The first is that, in the year of which
an analysis is given (1900), over nine-tenths of
the lynchings occurred in the South, where only
about one-third of the population of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
were, but where nine-tenths of the Negroes
were; secondly, that, of these lynchings, about
nine-tenths were of Negroes and one-third were
in the three States where the Negroes are most
numerous; thirdly, that, while the lynchings appear
to be diminishing at the South, the ratio,
at least, is increasing at the North. Of the
lynchings in 1903, 12 occurred in the North
and 92 in the South. Of the total number, 86
were Negroes, 17 were whites, and 1 a Chinaman.
Among the alleged causes were murder,
47; criminal assault, 11; attempted criminal assault,
10; murderous assault, 7; “race prejudice,”
5. Of those in 1904 there were 82
Negroes and 4 whites; 81 occurred in the South
and 5 in the North.</p>

<p>It further appears that, though after the
war lynching in the South may have begun
as a punishment for assault on white women,
it has extended until of late less than one-fourth
of the instances are for this crime,
while over three-fourths of them are for murder,
attempts at murder, or some less heinous
offence. This may be accounted for, in part,
by the fact that often the murders in the
South partake somewhat of the nature of race-conflicts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Over 2,700 lynchings in eighteen years, with
a steady increase in the barbarity of the method
and with the last the most shameful instance of
this barbarity, are enough to stagger the mind.
Either we are relapsing into barbarism, or there
is some terrific cause for our reversion to the
methods of mediævalism, and our laws are inefficient
to meet it. The only gleam of light is
that, of late years, the number appears to have
diminished.</p>

<p>To get at the remedy, we must first get at
the cause.</p>

<p>Although in early times there were occasional
assaults and even some burnings at the stake
these outrages appeared to have passed out of
fashion and time was when the crime of assault
was substantially unknown throughout the
South. Though criminal assaults had been
sufficiently common at one time for many of
the States to adopt laws of Draconian severity
relating to them, yet during the later period of
slavery, the crime of rape did not exist, nor did
it exist to any considerable extent for some years
after emancipation.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> During the war the men
were away in the army, and the Negroes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the loyal guardians of the women and children.
On isolated plantations and in lonely neighborhoods,
women were as secure as in the streets
of Boston or New York, indeed, were more
secure.</p>

<p>Then came the period and process of Reconstruction,
with its teachings. Among these was
the teaching that the Negro was the equal of
the white, that the white was his enemy, and
that he must assert his equality. The growth
of the idea was a gradual one in the Negro’s
mind. This was followed by a number of cases
where members of the Negro militia ravished
white women; in some instances in the presence
of their families.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The result of the hostility between the Southern
whites and Government at that time was
to throw the former upon reliance on their own
acts for their defence or revenge, with a consequent
training in lawless punishment of acts
which should have been punished by law. And
here lynching, in its post-bellum stage, had its
evil origin.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>It was suggested some time ago, in a thoughtful
paper read by Professor Wilcox, of Washington,
that a condition something like that
which exists in the South at present, had its rise
in France during the religious wars.</p>

<p>The first instance of rape, outside of these
attacks by armed Negroes, and of consequent
lynching, that attracted the attention of the
country after the war was a case which occurred
in Mississippi, where the teaching of equality
and of violence found one of its most fruitful
fields. A Negro dragged a woman down into
the woods and, tying her, kept her bound there
a prisoner for several days, when he butchered
her. He was caught and was lynched.</p>

<p>With the resumption of local power by the
whites came the temporary and partial ending
of the crimes of assault and of lynching.</p>

<p>As the old relation, which had survived even
the strain of Reconstruction, dwindled with the
passing of the old generation from the stage,
and the “New Issue” with the new teaching
took its place, the crime broke out again with
renewed violence. The idea of equality began
to percolate more extensively among the Negroes.
In evidence of it is the fact that since
the assaults began again they have been chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
directed against the plainer order of people, instances
of attacks on women of the upper class,
though not unknown, being of rare occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Conditions in the South render the commission
of this crime peculiarly easy. The white
population is sparse, the forests are extensive,
the officers of the law distant and difficult to
reach; but, above all, the Negro population
have appeared inclined to condone the fact of
mere assault.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, women went unaccompanied
and unafraid throughout the South,
as they still go throughout the North. To-day,
no white woman, or girl, or female child, goes
alone out of sight of the house except on necessity;
and no man leaves his wife alone in his
house, if he can help it. Cases have occurred
of assault and murder in broad day, within
sight and sound of the victim’s home. Indeed,
an instance occurred not a great while ago in
the District of Columbia, within a hundred
yards of a fashionable drive, when, about three
o’clock of a bright June day, a young girl was
attacked within sight and sound of her house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and when she screamed her throat was cut. So
near to her home was the spot that her mother
and an officer, hearing her cries, reached her
before life was extinct.</p>

<p>For a time, the ordinary course of the law
was, in the main, relied on to meet the trouble;
but it was found that, notwithstanding the inevitable
infliction of the death-penalty, several
evils resulted therefrom. The chief one was
that the ravishing of women, instead of diminishing,
steadily increased. The criminal, under
the ministrations of his preachers, usually professed
to have “got religion,” and from the
shadow of the gallows called on his friends to
follow him to glory. So that the punishment
lost to these emotional people much of its deterrent
force, especially where the real sympathy
of the race was mainly with the criminal
rather than with his victim. Another evil was
the dreadful necessity of calling on the innocent
victim, who, if she survived, as she rarely did,
was already bowed to the earth by shame, to
relate in public the story of the assault—an ordeal
which was worse than death. Yet another
was the constant delay in the execution of the
law. With these, however, was one other
which, perhaps, did more than all the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
taken together to wrest the trial and punishment
from the courts and carry them out by
mob-violence. This was the unnamable brutality
with which the causing crime was, in
nearly every case, attended. The death of the
victim of the ravisher was generally the least of
the attendant horrors. In Texas, in Mississippi,
in Georgia, in Kentucky, in Colorado, as later
in Delaware, the facts in the case were so
unspeakable that they have never been put in
print. They simply could not be put in print.
It is these unnamable horrors which have outraged
the minds of those who live in regions
where they have occurred, and where they may
at any time occur again, and, upsetting reason,
have swept from their bearings cool men and
changed them into madmen, drunk with fury
and the lust of revenge.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally, such barbarity as burning
at the stake has shocked the sense of the rest
of the country, and, indeed, of the world. But
it is well for the rest of the country, and for
the world, to know that it has also shocked the
sense of the South, and, in their calmer moments,
even the sense of those men who, in their
frenzy, have been guilty of it. Only, a deeper
shock than even this is at the bottom of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
ferocious rage—the shock which comes from
the ravishing and butchery of their women and
children.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to be an apologist for barbarity
because one states with bluntness the
cause. The stern underlying principle of the
people who commit these barbarities is one that
has its root deep in the basic passions of humanity;
the determination to put an end to the
ravishing of their women by an inferior race,
or by any race, no matter what the consequence.</p>

<p>For a time, a speedy execution by hanging
was the only mode of retribution resorted to
by the lynchers; then, when this failed of its
purpose, a more savage method was essayed,
born of a savage fury at the failure of the first,
and a stern resolve to strike a deeper terror into
those whom the other method had failed to
awe.</p>

<p>The following may serve as an illustration.
Ten or twelve years ago, the writer lectured
one afternoon in the early spring in a town
in the cotton-belt of Texas—one of the prettiest
towns in the Southwest. The lecture was
delivered in the Court-house. The writer was
introduced by a gentleman who had been a
member of the Confederate Cabinet and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Senator of the United States, and the audience
was composed of refined and cultured people,
representing, perhaps, every State from Maine
to Texas.</p>

<p>Two days later, the papers contained the account
of the burning at the stake of a Negro
in this town. He had picked up a little girl of
five or six years of age on the street where she
was playing in front of her home, and carried
her off, telling her that her mother had sent
him for her; and when she cried, he had soothed
her with candy which, with deliberate and devilish
prevision, he had bought for the purpose.
When the child was found, she was unrecognizable.
Her little body was broken and mangled
and he had cut her throat and thrown her
into a ditch.</p>

<p>A strong effort was made to save the wretch
for the law, but without avail: the people had
reverted to the primal law of personal and awful
vengeance. Farmers came from fifty miles
around to see that vengeance was exacted. They
had resolved to strike terror into the breasts of
all who might contemplate so hideous a crime,
so that such a thing should never occur again.</p>

<p>This was, perhaps, the second or third instance
of burning in the country after the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Of late, lynching at the stake has spread beyond
the region where it has such reason for
existence as may be given by the conditions that
prevail in the South. Three frightful instances
of burning at the stake have occurred recently
in Northern States, in communities where some
of these conditions were partly wanting. The
horror of the main crime of lynching was increased,
in two of the cases, by a concerted
attack on a large element of the Negro population
which was wholly innocent. Even unoffending
Negroes were driven from their homes,
a consequence which has never followed in the
South, where it might seem there was more
occasion for it.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the original crime, and
also the consequent one in its most brutal form,
are not confined to the South, and, possibly, are
only more frequent there because of the greater
number of Negroes in that section. The deep
racial instincts are not limited by geographical
bounds.</p>

<p>These last-mentioned lynchings were so ferocious,
and so unwarranted by any such necessity,
real or fancied, as may be thought to exist
at the South by reason of the frequency of assault
and the absence of a strong police force,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
that they not unnaturally called forth almost
universal condemnation. The President felt it
proper to write an open letter, commending the
action of the Governor of Indiana on the
proper and efficient exercise of his authority to
uphold the law and restore order in his State.
But who has ever thought it necessary to commend
the Governors of the Southern States
under similar circumstances? The militia of
some of the Southern States are almost veterans,
so frequently have they been called on to
protect wretches whose crimes stank in the nostrils
of all decent men. The recent shameful
instance where an officer is charged with having
connived with the mob is the single exception to
fidelity that can be recalled, and even in that case
the men showed a fidelity in marked contrast
to that weakness. The Governor of Virginia
boasted, a few years ago, that no lynching
should take place during his incumbency, and
he nearly made good his boast; though, to do
so, he had to call out at one time or another
almost the entire military force of the State.</p>

<p>Editorials in some of the Eastern papers note
with astonishment recent instances where law-officers
in the South have protected their prisoners
or eluded a mob. The writers of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
editorials know so little of the South that one
is scarcely surprised at their ignorance. But
men are hanged by law for this crime of assault
every few months in some State in the
South. A few years ago, Sheriff Smith, of Birmingham,
protected a murderer at the cost of
many lives; a little later, Mayor Prout, of Roanoke,
defended with all his power a Negro
ravisher and murderer, and, though the mob
finally succeeded in their aim, six men were killed
by the guards before the jail was carried. These
are only two of the many instances in which
brave and faithful officers have, at the risk of
their lives, defended their charges against that
most terrible of all assailants—a determined
mob.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>For a time, the assaults by Negroes were confined
to young women who were caught alone
in solitary and secluded places. The company
even of a child was sufficient to protect them.
Then the ravishers grew bolder, and attacks
followed on women when they were in company.
And then, not content with this, the ravishers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
began to attack women in their own
homes. Sundry instances of this have occurred
within the last few years. As an illustration,
may be cited the notorious case of Samuel Hose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
who, after making a bet with a Negro preacher
that he could have access to a white woman,
went into a farmer’s house while the family,
father, mother, and child, were at supper;
brained the man with his axe; threw the child
into a corner with a violence which knocked it
senseless, ravished the wife and mother with unnamable
horrors, and finally butchered her. He
was caught and was burned.</p>

<p>Another instance, only less appalling, occurred
two years ago in Lynchburg, Va.,
where the colored janitor of a white female
school, who had been brought up and promoted
by the Superintendent of Schools, and was regarded
as a shining example of what education
might accomplish with his race, entered the
house of a respectable man one morning, after
the husband, a foreman in a factory, had gone
to his work; ravished the wife, and, then putting
his knee on her breast, coolly cut her throat
as he might have done that of a calf. There was
no attempt at lynching; but the Governor, resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to preserve the good name of the Commonwealth,
felt it necessary to order out two
regiments of soldiers, in which course he was
sustained by the entire sentiment of the State.</p>

<p>These cases were neither worse nor better
than many of those which have occurred in the
South in the last twenty years, and in that period
hundreds of women and a number of children
have been ravished and slain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now, how is this crime of assault to be
stopped? For stopped it must be, and stopped
it will be, whatever the cost. One proposition
is that separation of the races, complete separation
by the deportation of the Negroes, is
the only remedy. The theory, though sustained
by many thoughtful men, appears Utopian.
Colonization has been the dream of certain
philanthropists for a hundred years. And,
meantime, the Negroes have increased from
less than a million to nine millions. They
will never be deported; not because we have not
the money, for an amount equal to that spent
in pensions during three years would pay the
expenses of such deportation, and an amount
equal to that paid in six years would set them
up in a new country. But the Negroes have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
rights; many of them are estimable citizens; and
even the great body of them, when well regulated,
are valuable laborers. It might, therefore,
as well be assumed that this plan will
never be carried out, unless the occasion becomes
so imperative that all other rights give
way to the supreme right of necessity.</p>

<p>It is plain, then, that we must deal with the
matter in a more practicable manner, accepting
conditions as they are, and applying to them
legal methods which will be effective. Lynching
does not end ravishing, and that is the prime
necessity. Most right-thinking men are agreed
as to this. Indeed, lynching, through lacking
the supreme principle of law, the deliberateness
from which is supposed to come the certainty
of identification, fails utterly to meet the necessity
of the case even as a deterrent, though it
must be admitted that there are a respectable
number of thoughtful men who dissent from
this view. The growth of a sentiment which,
at least, condones lynching as a punishment for
assaults on women is a significant and distressing
fact. Not only have assaults occurred
again and again in the same neighborhood
where lynching has followed such crime; but, a
few years ago, it was publicly stated that a Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
who had just witnessed a lynching for this
crime actually committed an assault on his way
home. However this may be, lynching as a
remedy is a ghastly failure; and its brutalizing
effect on the community is incalculable.</p>

<p>The charge that is often made, that the innocent
are sometimes lynched, has little foundation.
The rage of a mob is not directed against
the innocent, but against the guilty; and its
fury would not be satisfied with any other sacrifice
than the death of the real criminal. Nor
does the criminal merit any consideration, however
terrible the punishment. The real injury
is to the perpetrators of the crime of destroying
the law, and to the community in which the
law is slain.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally conceded that the
“law’s delay” is partly responsible for the
“wild justice” of mob vengeance, and this has
undoubtedly been the cause of many mobs. But
it is far from certain if any change in the methods
of administration of law will effect the stopping
of lynching; while to remedy this evil we
may bring about a greater peril. Trial by jury
is the bed-rock of our liberties, and the inherent
principle of such trial is its deliberateness. It
has been said that the whole purpose of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
Constitution of Great Britain is that twelve
men may sit in the jury-box. The methods of
the law may well be reformed; but any movement
should be jealously scanned which touches
the chief bulwark of all liberty.</p>

<p>The first step, then, would appear to be the
establishment of a system securing a reasonably
prompt trial and speedy execution by law, rather
than a wholesale revolution of the existing
system.</p>

<p>Many expedients have been suggested; some
of the most drastic by Northern men. One of
them proposed, not long since, that to meet the
mob-spirit, a trial somewhat in the nature of
a drum-head court-martial might be established
by law, by which the accused may be tried and,
if found guilty, executed immediately. Others
have proposed as a remedy emasculation by
law; while a Justice of the Supreme Court has
recently given the weight of his personal opinion
in favor of prompt trial and the abolishment
of appeals in such cases. Even the terrible
suggestion has been made that burning at
the stake might again be legalized!</p>

<p>These suggestions testify how grave the matter
is considered to be by those who make them.</p>

<p>But none of these, unless it be the one relating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
to emasculation, is more than an expedient.
The trouble lies deeper. The crime of lynching
is not likely to cease until the crime of ravishing
and murdering women and children is
less frequent than it has been of late. And this
crime, which is well-nigh wholly confined to the
Negro race, will not greatly diminish until the
Negroes themselves take it in hand and stamp
it out.</p>

<p>From recent developments, it may be properly
inferred that the absence of this crime during
the later period of slavery was due more to
the feeling among the Negroes themselves than
to any repressive measures on the part of the
whites. The Negro had the same animal instincts
in slavery that he exhibits now; the punishment
that follows the crime now is quite as
certain, as terrible, and as swift as it could have
been then. So, to what is due the alarming increase
of this terrible brutality?</p>

<p>To the writer it appears plain that it is due
to two things: first, to racial antagonism and
to the talk of social equality that inflames the
ignorant Negro, who has grown up unregulated
and undisciplined; and, secondly, to the absence
of a strong restraining public opinion among
the Negroes of any class, which alone can extirpate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the crime. In the first place, the Negro
does not generally believe in the virtue of women.
It is beyond his experience. He does not
generally believe in the existence of actual assault.
It is beyond his comprehension. In the
next place, his passion, always his controlling
force, is now, since the new teaching, for the
white women.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>That there are many Negroes who are law-abiding
and whose influence is for good, no
one who knows the worthy members of the
race—those who represent the better element—will
deny. But while there are, of course, notable
exceptions, they are not often of the
“New Issue,” nor, unhappily, even generally
among the prominent leaders: those who publish
papers and control conventions.</p>

<p>As the crime of rape of late years had its baleful
renascence in the teaching of equality and
the placing of power in the ignorant Negroes’
hands, so its perpetuation and increase have undoubtedly
been due in large part to the same
teaching. The intelligent Negro may understand
what social equality truly means, but to
the ignorant and brutal young Negro, it signifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
but one thing: the opportunity to enjoy,
equally with white men, the privilege of cohabiting
with white women. This the whites of the
South understand; and if it were understood
abroad, it would serve to explain some things
which have not been understood hitherto. It
will explain, in part, the universal and furious
hostility of the South to even the least suggestion
of social equality.</p>

<p>A close following of the instances of rape
and lynching, and the public discussion consequent
thereon, have led the writer to the painful
realization that even the leaders of the Negro
race—at least, those who are prominent enough
to hold conventions and write papers on the
subject—have rarely, by act or word, shown a
true appreciation of the enormity of the crime
of ravishing and murdering women. Their discussion
and denunciation have been almost invariably
and exclusively devoted to the crime
of lynching. Underlying most of their protests
is the suggestion that the victim of the
mob is innocent and a martyr. Now and then,
there is a mild generalization on the evil of lawbreaking
and the violation of women; but, for
one stern word of protest against violating
women and cutting their throats, the records of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Negro meetings will show many resolutions
against the attack of the mob on the criminal.
And, as to any serious and determined effort
to take hold of and stamp out the crime that is
blackening the good name of the entire Negro
race to-day, and arousing against them the fatal
and possibly the undying enmity of the stronger
race, there is, with the exception of the utterances
of a few score individuals like Booker T.
Washington, who always speaks for the right,
Hannibal Thomas, and Bishop Turner, hardly
a trace of such a thing. A crusade has been
preached against lynching, even as far as England;
but none has been attempted against the
ravishing and tearing to pieces of white women
and children.</p>

<p>Happily, there is an element of sound-minded,
law-abiding Negroes, representative of
the old Negro, who without parade stand for
good order, and do what they can to repress
lawlessness among their people. Except for this
class and for the kindly relations which are preserved
between them and the whites, the situation
in the South would long since have become
unbearable. These, however, are not generally
among the leaders, and, unfortunately, their influence
is not sufficiently extended to counteract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the evil influences which are at work with such
fatal results.</p>

<p>One who reads the utterances of Negro orators,
editors and preachers on the subject of
lynching, and who knows the Negro race, cannot
doubt that, at bottom, their sympathy is
generally with the “victim” of the mob, and
not with his victim.</p>

<p>Denunciatory resolutions may be adopted
without end, and newspapers may rave over the
reversion to barbarism shown by the prevalence
of the mob spirit. But it may safely be asserted
that until the Negroes shall create among themselves
a sound public opinion which, instead of
fostering, shall reprobate and sternly repress
the crime of assaulting women and children, the
crime will never be extirpated, and until this
crime is stopped the crime of lynching will never
be extirpated. Lynching will never be done
away with while the sympathy of the whites is
with the lynchers, and no more will ravishing
be done away with while the sympathy of the
Negroes is with the ravisher. When the Negroes
shall stop applying all their energies to
harboring and exculpating Negroes, no matter
what their crime may be so it be against the
whites, and shall distinguish between the law-abiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Negro and the lawbreaker, a long step
will have been taken.</p>

<p>Should the Negroes sturdily and faithfully
set themselves to prevent the crime of rape by
members of that race, it could be stamped out.
Should the whites set themselves against lynching,
lynching would be stopped. Even though
lynching is not now confined to the punishment
of this crime, this crime is the one that gives
the only excuse for lynching. The remedy
then is plain. Let the Negroes take charge of
the crime of ravishing and firmly put it away
from them, and let the whites take charge of
the crime of lynching and put it away from
them. It is time that the races should address
themselves to the task; for it is with nations as
with individual men; whatsoever they sow that
shall they also reap.</p>

<p>It is the writer’s belief that the arrest and the
prompt handing over to the law of Negroes by
Negroes, for assault on white women, would
do more to break up ravishing, and to restore
amicable relations between the two races, than
all the resolutions of all the conventions and all
the harangues of all the politicians.</p>

<p>It has been tried in various States to put an
end to lynching by making the county in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the lynching occurs liable in damages for the
crime. It is a good theory; and, if it has not
worked well, it is because of the difficulty of
executing the provision. Could some plan be
devised to array each race against the crime
to which it is prone, both rape and lynching
might be diminished if not wholly prevented.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The practical application of such a principle
is difficult, but, perhaps, it is not impossible. It
is possible that in every community Negroes
might be appointed officers of the law, to look
exclusively after lawbreakers of their own race.
The English in the East manage such matters
well, under equally complicated and delicate
conditions. For example, in the Island of
Malta, where the population is of different
classes among whom a certain jealousy exists,
there are several classes of police: the naval
police, the military police, and the civil or municipal
police. To each of these is assigned
more especially the charge of one of the three
classes of whom the population of the island
is composed. Again, in Hong Kong, where the
situation is even more delicate, there are several
classes of police: the English, the Chinese,
and the Indian police. Only the first are empowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
to make general arrests; the others
have powers relating exclusively to the good
order of the races to which they belong, though
they may in all cases be called in to assist the
English police.</p>

<p>Somewhat in the same way, the Negroes
might be given within their province powers
sufficiently full to enable them to keep order
among their people, and they might on the
other hand be held to a certain accountability
for such good order. It might even be required
that every person should be listed and steadily
kept track of, as is done in Germany at present.
The recent vagrant laws of Georgia, where
there are more Negroes than in the entire
North, constitute an attempt in this direction.</p>

<p>In the same way, the white officials charged
with the good order of the county or town
might be given enlarged powers of summoning
<em>posses</em>, and might be held to a high accountability.
For example, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> forfeiture of the
officers’ official bond and removal from office,
with perpetual disability to hold any office
again, might be provided as a penalty for permitting
any persons to be taken out of their
hands.</p>

<p>Few ravishings by Negroes would occur if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the more influential members of the race were
charged with responsibilities for the good order
of their race in every community; and few lynchings
would occur, at least after the prisoners
were in the hands of the officers of the law, if
those officers by the mere fact of relinquishing
their prisoners should be disqualified from ever
holding office again.</p>

<p>These suggestions may be as Utopian as
others which have been made; but if they cannot
be carried out, it is because the ravishings
by Negroes and the murders by mobs have their
roots so deep in racial instincts that nothing can
eradicate them, and in such case the ultimate
issue will be a resort to the final test of might,
which in the last analysis underlies everything.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> An interesting paper on “Lynch Law,” by Albert
Matthews, of Boston, was published in The Nation, December
4, 1902. Mr. Matthews, after giving the numerous
alleged derivations of the term, and reciting a score or so
of instances in which “Lynch Law” had been applied (his
first reference being to Wirt’s Life of Patrick Henry, 1818,
page 372), states his conclusions, as follows:</p>

<p>“From this evidence and from other material in my possession,
it appears that the original term was “Lynch’s
Law”; that this was soon shortened to “Lynch (or lynch)
Law,” and then to “Lynch”; that originally lynch law
was a whipping or other personal chastisement; that lynch
law originally obtained only in the border settlements,
where the administration of justice either was, or was supposed
to be uncertain; that in the early days of lynch law,
innocent persons were sometimes punished, and suits for
damages were by no means unknown; that, about 1830,
writers regarded the practice as on the wane and likely soon
to disappear altogether; that before about 1835 the victims
of lynch law were generally whites, occasionally Indians,
but never Negroes; that soon after 1830 a revival of lynch
law took place, due to the anti-slavery agitation, and the
practice spread throughout the country; that between 1830
and 1840 the term “lynch” underwent a change in meaning
and “to lynch” began to acquire the sense of to put to
death; that during the same period Negroes were first
lynched; that about 1835, we first hear of “Judge Lynch”;
that in recent years, lynching has been confined largely,
but by no means wholly, to Negroes in the South and West.
It further appears that there is a direct historical connection
between the killing of a Negro in a highly civilized community
in 1902 and the whipping of a white man along the
frontiers in 1817. Step by step, the illegal whippings of
1817 have led to the illegal burnings alive of 1902. In
short, the more civilized the country has become, the more
brutal has been the punishment meted out under lynch law.”</p>

the illegal punishment of the crime.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> It is significant that, on large plantations where the

<p>There were 80 hanged in the South and 39 in the North,
of whom 60 were whites, 58 were blacks, and one a Chinaman.
The crimes for which they were executed were:
murder, 113; rape, 5; arson, 1. Thus, of the 119 hangings,
about two-thirds (80) were in the South and one-third (39)
in the North; about one-half (60) of the entire number
were of whites, and one-half (58) were of blacks. So, the
South appears to have done its part in the matter of punishing
by law as well as by violence.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PARTIAL DISFRANCHISEMENT OF THE
NEGRO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Among the various factors that have
contributed to bring about the recrudescence
of the Negro question in
the last year or two a prominent one is the
movement in the South to disfranchise the ignorant
element of the Negro race. This is usually
termed the “Disfranchisement of the Negro.”
But although the object of the movement is
frankly to disfranchise the large ignorant element
among that race, while an ignorant element
among the whites is left the ballot, the
term is by no means exact.</p>

<p>Few things are rarer yet nothing is more important
than accuracy in definitions. In the
matter under consideration much misapprehension
exists as to the extent of the disfranchisement,
and possibly more as to its effect.</p>

<p>Reams of paper have been covered with frantic
denunciation; courts have been appealed to;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
threats have been made against the Southern
States of reducing their representation in Congress,
and still the movement has gone on under
the direction of the most enlightened and conservative
men in the South. And so far as has
yet been tested, it has proceeded by legal
methods.</p>

<p>The disfranchisement clauses have not only
caused an outcry on the part of the politicians,
white and colored, and the doctrinaires who
were brought up on hostility to the South, but
they have excited unfavorable comment even
among some friendly enough to the South, who,
while conceding that the former “experiment”
has proved a disastrous failure so far as the
South is concerned, yet believe that a manifest
injustice is done to the rest of the country by
one section holding a representation in Congress
which, according to the votes cast there, appears
to be in excess of that held by the rest of
the country.</p>

<p>A singular feature of the case is that the
division-line of opinion for or against the measure
is not so much that of party affiliation as
that of familiarity with the conditions that have
brought about the changes in the constitutions
of the Southern States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Within the last year, a man of national reputation,
a gentleman of high standing, of broad
sympathies and much learning,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> whose affiliations
are with the party that is dominant in the
South, in an address before the New England
Suffrage Conference, warmly approved the reconstruction
measures of Thaddeus Stevens setting
aside the civil governments in the South,
putting the Southern States under military control,
and providing for the Congressional system
of reconstruction based on Negro suffrage.
“The measure finally adopted was,” he says,
“of proved necessity. Thus, and thus only,
could the lives of the colored men and white
Union men be protected. They needed every
weapon that we could place in their hands, and
this weapon was among them.”</p>

<p>This statement presents clearly the basic error
which underlies all others. It is that the
Negro needs “weapons” with which to oppose
the white, and that “we” must place them in
his hands.</p>

<p>Yet another gentleman of varied experience
and extensive general knowledge,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> whose affiliations
have at times been with the same party,
has recently published a paper written with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
his well-known ability, based, however, mainly
on a study which he made of conditions at the
South during a rapid tour in 1865. Neither
of these gentlemen has added much to his
knowledge of the Negro question since that
time. That men of these gentlemen’s standing
can really believe at this day the facts stated
by them demonstrates the hopelessness of ever
having the matter clearly viewed by a large
body of well-meaning people.</p>

<p>The weapon which the advocate of universal
suffrage applauds himself for having helped
to place in the Negro’s hands has been his destruction.
It was a torch placed in the hands
of a child, with which he has ravaged all about
him and involved himself in the general conflagration.</p>

<p>Happily, this somewhat outworn view of
conditions at the South is not the view of the
body of the American people who have any
familiarity with the subject, or of any portion
of them who have had experience of the conditions
which existed under the Negro <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>A respectable element among the white Republicans
of the South have given it up. One
of the most distinguished and thoughtful Northern
men in the country, a life-long Republican,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
a man of approved Republicanism, declared
before the leading Republican club of the country
not long ago, that the “experiment entered
on with so much enthusiasm” had undoubtedly
proved a failure.</p>

<p>Looking back on this period, it is impossible
for the open-minded student not to see that
whatever the motive, the result was, as Mr.
Root declared before the Union League Club,
a miserable failure, disastrous to both races.
The South was devastated and humiliated beyond
belief; the Negroes were hopelessly misled
in matters where right direction was vitally
necessary to their permanent progress.
And the consequence was a riot of civic debauchery
which must bring shame to every honest
man of the African race and will always
prove a bar to the possibility of Negro domination
hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Whether it be recognized as yet or not, the
whole country owes a debt to the Southern people
who withstood to the end the policy of the
misguided fanatics and politicians who would
have put the South permanently under Negro
domination. But for the resolution and constancy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of the Southern whites, one-sixth of the
then existing States of the Union would have
become Negroized and we should possibly
have had by this time several States of the
Union substantially what Santo Domingo is
to-day.</p>

<p>As the realization is becoming more common
that the “experiment” which was entered
on with so much enthusiasm a generation ago,
of arming the Negro with “the weapon” of
the ballot, has proved a disastrous failure, it
is also gradually being recognized that the kind
of education on which so much money, both
from public taxation and from private philanthropy,
has been lavished, and so much care
has been expended, has not only failed to bring
about the results which had been expected, but
has, so far as the great body of the race is concerned,
proved an absolute failure. The Negroes
at large and the doctrinaires will not accept
this, but nevertheless it is recognized by
those who know the Negro best and have sufficient
breadth of knowledge to look at things as
they are. The sanest and most broad-minded
among the Negro leaders of to-day has recognized
it, and the foundation of his success is his
recognition of it—the recognition of it by him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and the recognition of it by the whites of the
South, who have, because of it, sustained him
by their sympathy and their aid. It is because
of this that Booker T. Washington has become
the best proof of what the Negro race at its
best may produce, and is the most unanswerable
argument adduced since the war of the value of
Negro education.</p>

<p>He believes that the Negroes at large should
be taught, first of all, to work; that they
should begin by being made trained laborers
and skilled artisans, and that then they will
develop themselves. This principle, though
sound, is strongly repudiated by a considerable
element among the more advanced Negroes.
And the riot in the Boston church in July, 1903,
when the Principal of Tuskegee spoke on the
industrial training of the Negro, was precipitated
by an educated element who believe in
agitation rather than in Principal Washington’s
pacific and rational methods. The latter
acts on the theory that, in the main, the education
of the Negroes as hitherto conducted has
not been generally a success. Those who
espouse the other view assert, on the contrary,
that the education has been a marked success
and that the Negro is in every way the equal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the white. And to prove their case they use
red pepper and razors.</p>

<p>The limits of this paper do not admit of even
the most cursory discussion of the comparative
equality of the two races. It may be stated,
however, that, notwithstanding exceptional instances,
the case of the South rests frankly on
the present demonstrable inferiority of the Negro
race to the White race. Its superiority is a
dogma of the White race wherever it may have
established itself, and without doubt, as Mr.
Chamberlain recently pointed out in his address
at Birmingham, this profound conviction has
been one of the sources of its strength.</p>

<p>Much injury has been done the Negro race
by the misdirected zeal of those who continually
prate about their right to equality with
the whites.</p>

<p>In 1865, when the Negro was set free,
he held without a rival the entire field of
industrial labor throughout the South. Ninety-five
per cent. of all the industrial work of the
Southern States was in his hands. And he was
fully competent to do it. Every adult was
either a skilled laborer or a trained mechanic.
It was the fallacious teaching of equality which
deluded him into dropping the substance for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
shadow. To-day their wisest leader is trying
to emulate his great teacher, Armstrong, and
lead them back to the field which they so carelessly
abandoned. Men who are the equals of
others do not go about continually asserting it.
They show their equality by the fruits of their
intellect and character. Among the whites, the
poor class are not always haranguing and adopting
resolutions as to their equality with the
other classes, any more than are the well-to-do
class always insisting upon their equality with
the wealthy class. They know that they are
equal, if not superior, and do not feel continually
called on to assert it offensively. The same
may be said about the best educated, best behaved,
and most worthy among the Negroes.
It is the blatant demagogue and “mouthy”
Negro—a term that was well known during the
period of slavery—who is mainly heard on this
subject. Happily for the Negroes, the major
portion of them have retired from the struggle
for political power, and, except when excited by
agitators, live harmoniously enough with the
whites; and the industrious element are saving,
and are building themselves homes.</p>

<p>While, however, the body of the Negro race
are going about their business in good-humored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
content, generally in good fellowship with the
people on whose friendship they are most dependent,
the so-called “leaders” and their so-called
“friends” are spending their time in
stirring them up, adopting lurid resolutions,
asserting their equality and calling on everybody
outside of the South to help them establish
it.</p>

<p>The phrase usually employed is that the Negro
is “robbed of his vote,” this formula being
equally applied whether he is restrained from
voting by the unlawful act of one or more individuals
or by the most solemn act that a people
can perform—the provision of a duly ordained
constitution.</p>

<p>It may be well, at the outset of the discussion
of this matter, to call attention to a fact somewhat
generally overlooked: that the right to
vote is not an inherent right. It is a privilege
conferred by positive enactment on those citizens
possessed of certain specified qualifications.</p>

<p>Further, the right to determine the qualification
for the suffrage—that is, to declare on
what condition a citizen shall exercise the suffrage—rests
with the several States; the only
limitation to this being the express restrictions
contained in the Constitution of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
States bearing on the subject. Where a State
duly enacts a law it stands until it is changed
by law or is declared invalid by the proper court
of competent jurisdiction. Its provisions are
until then the law.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go largely into the history
of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
They were the offspring of ignorance
and passion. They were adopted partly to punish
the South, partly to arm the Negroes with
a weapon which would enable them to hold
their own against the whites, and partly to perpetuate
the ascendancy of the radical wing of
the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Prior to, and even for some time subsequent
to the war, the idea of endowing the Negro
race generally with the ballot had not been seriously
entertained by any considerable portion of
the American people.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln again and again, during his debates
with Douglas, declared his opposition to
the idea. He said in one of his speeches: “I
am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing
about in any way the social and political
equality of the white and black races; I am not
nor ever have been in favor of making voters
or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them
to hold office or intermarry with the white people;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
and I will say in addition, that there is a
physical difference between the white and black
races which, I believe, will ever forbid the two
races living together on terms of social and political
equality.”</p>

<p>This declaration he reiterated in a speech
delivered at Columbus. The furthest he ever
went in favor of admitting any Negroes to the
privilege of the ballot was when, on March 13,
1864, in his letter to his provisional governor
in Louisiana, Governor Hahn, he said: “I
barely suggest, for your private consideration,
whether some of the colored people may not
be let in: as, for instance, the very intelligent
and especially those who have fought so gallantly
in our ranks.”</p>

<p>Of the thirty-four States which formed the
Union in January, 1861, thirty excluded Negroes
from the franchise by constitutional provision;
while in the four States whose constitutions
contained no such provision—New York,
Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire—owing
to the small number of Negroes among
their population, and the property and educational
qualifications, the Negro vote was so
small as to be a negligible quantity.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>The opposition to universal Negro suffrage
was so great throughout the North during the
agitation of the question which was subsequently
embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment,
that, excluding the enforced acquiescence of the
Southern States, it was when submitted to the
people defeated in every State except Iowa and
Minnesota.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> After the adoption of the Amendment
other States voted for it.</p>

<p>It is probable that, had the South not been
so intractable in matters relating to the Negroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the admission of the Negroes to the suffrage
would have been along the line suggested by
Mr. Lincoln to Governor Hahn. But at that
time it was deemed necessary to quell the South
though the heavens fell. Moreover, there was
grave danger that the South might again hold
the balance of power in the National Assembly.
With stern and reckless determination the implacable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
leaders of the radical wing of the dominant
party created what one of them termed
a force of “perpetual allies.”</p>

<p>Having been drilled by years of slavery to
follow the lead of their masters, and being reasonably
apt at imitation, these allies followed
slavishly the direction of their new leaders. It
was perfectly natural that they should at that
time have given themselves unreservedly to the
representatives of the agencies which had emancipated
them, which stood for them, and which
held out to them such glittering rewards as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
complete equality with, and finally domination
over, their former masters. Possibly, it was
not unnatural that they should have followed
with unexampled credulity the most unprincipled
among those representatives who steadily held
out to them greater and greater rewards.</p>

<p>However it was, this was the history of
the exercise of the suffrage. With the weapon
of the ballot, the Negro soon exceeded the
expectation of the most sanguine advocate of
Negro suffrage. Only the supreme constancy
of the Southern whites saved the Southern
States.</p>

<p>From this beginning, every question became a
race question, until to-day no question can arise
which is not regarded by the Negroes generally
from a racial standpoint. It may be asserted
that this was quite natural. But the fact
that it is so is the best argument for the Southern
view.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat curious if not pertinent fact
that in the place where Negro suffrage was first
established by Act of Congress, the District of
Columbia (where it was established by the Act
of January 8, 1867), which has always been
under the direct control of National Government,
subsequent conditions became so insupportable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
that it was deemed necessary to do
away with the ballot altogether.</p>

<p>In all the years that have passed the same
unhappy condition has continued. The Negroes
remained solidly banded against the whites.
This solidarity effectually prevented the whites
from dividing on any of the great economic
questions of the time. To meet this condition,
one method after another was essayed. At times
force was openly resorted to to prevent the recurrence
of conditions that rendered life unbearable;
at times shifts came into vogue that no
one pretended to excuse except by the argument
of necessity—such, for example, as the system
of having separate ballot-boxes for each candidate,
with a view to shifting them about; the
system of “understanding-clauses” unequally
applied; the system of ballot-box stuffing; the
system of bribery, whether of leaders or of
individuals.</p>

<p>In some places the question was seriously debated
whether it was worse to use force or
fraud, the necessity for one or the other being
simply assumed. In others, some Negroes substantially
auctioned off their votes.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>The result of such conditions was the retirement
of many of the best men in the South from
all part in public affairs, the withdrawal of
the South from due participation in all other
questions of the national life, the menace of the
debauchery of public morals.</p>

<p>In this wretched state of affairs the Southern
people resolved to eliminate by law, as far as
possible, the ignorant Negro vote. How universal
the conviction was of its necessity may
be judged from the fact that it has been attempted
in nearly every State in the South.
How legal it may be is a question for the Supreme
Court of the United States.</p>

<p>The new movement is being followed by
stringent laws striking at all debauchery of the
ballot.</p>

<p>As absolutely necessary, however, as the
South has deemed this movement, perhaps nothing
of late has done more to arouse feeling in
the North, than the small vote cast in the latter
section. It would appear as though the North
deemed itself discriminated against and consequently
injured by this action. The charge is
constantly made that owing to this disfranchisement,
the South has a larger representation
than the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>This idea has recently been set forth in a
paper in one of the leading magazines, which,
admitting that the law has not been contravened,
has yet gone so far as to suggest that a
sixteenth amendment to the Constitution of the
United States should be adopted to rectify this
inequality. This suggestion would appear to be
based on a false conception of the fundamental
law. Representation is apportioned by law according
to the number of the population, not of
the voting population, and each State has the
absolute right to make its qualification for the
suffrage high or otherwise, subject only to the
restrictions contained in the amendments to the
Constitution.</p>

<p>The feeling seems to be that in some way the
South without violating the amendments, has,
by proving that they do not cover the case, secured
an undue advantage over the North. It
is, however, difficult to understand how it
should be an advantage when a State, by acting
within the law, simply cuts down its suffrage
list. How was North Carolina, which in 1880
cast a vote equal to 81 per cent. of its voting
population injured by the fact that Massachusetts
in that election cast only 56 per cent. of its
voting population; or how was South Carolina,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
which, that year, cast 82 per cent. of its entire
vote, injured by Rhode Island’s casting only 37
per cent.? How would Delaware, which requires
no qualification for the suffrage, except
that a resident voter shall have paid a registration
fee of $1, be discriminated against by the
fact that California provides that only those may
vote who can read the Constitution in English
and can write his name; or, how are the people
of Colorado, where women, as well as men vote,
injured by the fact that only men vote in Massachusetts
and Virginia?</p>

<p>Yet, as plain as this would have seemed, the
action of the Southern States has undoubtedly
aroused a feeling in the North that the Northern
people have, in some way, been injured
thereby.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to cut down the representation
of the Southern States in Congress,
and resolutions have been introduced in Congress
to carry out this idea. Possibly the movement
has not been as serious as it has appeared.
However, it has been already serious enough in
its consequences to excite the Negroes into a
state of renewed aggressiveness.</p>

<p>This proposition, which is intended to be
partly monitory and partly punitive, is warmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
advocated by most if not all of the Negro leaders
and their doctrinaire friends.</p>

<p>It would undoubtedly be strongly opposed
by the majority of the white people of the
South, and possibly by some of the more far-sighted
friends of the Negro race outside of the
South, who, looking a little beyond the immediate
disfranchisement of ignorant Negroes, see
that the ultimate effect will be to establish a
general and impartial electoral system, based
on the disfranchisement of ignorance and vice.</p>

<p>Before the proposal is carried into effect, it
might be well for its advocates to consider certain
facts.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is a grave question
whether the section of the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Federal Constitution on which
such action must be based is now valid or
whether it was not repealed by the Fifteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits
disfranchisement on account of race, color,
etc. The latter view was taken and was ably
argued in the recent notable address delivered in
Albany in June, 1903, by Charles A. Gardiner,
Esq., of New York, before the Forty-first Annual
Convocation of the University of the State
of New York. He maintains that “a State can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
discriminate against Negro suffrage only by
an organic or statutory law,” and that before
Congress can penalize a State such a law must
be adopted and it must be a valid law. But
(he argues) since the adoption of the Fifteenth
Amendment, no law which violated its provision
could be valid. It would not merely be
voidable, but void <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab initio</i>. “And a void law
is no law.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But even assuming that the Congress might
have the authority to cut down the representation
under the present law, it is a question
whether the disfranchising clauses of the New
Constitution in the Southern States afford any
basis for such an attempt at reduction in their
representation.</p>

<p>The qualifications for voting in the various
States of the South would not seem to be in
any way improper on the face of their constitutions.
The impropriety charged against them
is based wholly on the fact that they disfranchise
more of one class of citizens than of
others.</p>

<p>According to the tabulation of the “Qualifications
for Voting in each State in the Union,”
published in the <cite>World</cite> Almanac for 1904, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
“communicated to it” and corrected to date
“by the Attorneys-General of the respective
States,” all the States except the two Carolinas
have the “Australian Ballot Law,” or a modification
of it, in force, and all the States require
that the “Voters shall be citizens of the State
or of the United States, or an alien who has
declared intention to become naturalized”; and
all the States except Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Hampshire, and Vermont exclude
from the right of suffrage those convicted
of felony or infamous crime, unless pardoned.</p>

<p>Besides these, paupers and persons <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non
compos mentis</i> are generally excluded. These
provisions are general.</p>

<p>Arkansas, however, excludes from the right
to the suffrage those who have failed to pay
the poll-tax. California excludes everyone unable
to read the Constitution in English and to
write his name. Connecticut requires for citizenship
that a man shall be a citizen of the
United States who can read the English language.
Delaware requires the payment of a
registration fee of $1; Georgia requires the payment
of all taxes since 1877. Louisiana admits
only those able to read and write, or who own
$300 worth of property assessed in their names,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
or whose father or grandfather was entitled to
vote on January 1, 1867. (This last is the
celebrated “Squaw Clause.”) Massachusetts
admits only those who can read and write.
Mississippi admits only those who can read or
understand the Constitution when read to them.
Missouri requires voters to have paid their poll-taxes
for the current year. Pennsylvania requires
a voter, if twenty-two years of age or
more, to have paid taxes within two years.
South Carolina requires that a voter shall have
paid six months prior to the election any poll-taxes
then due, and shall be able to read and
write any section of the State Constitution, or to
show that he owns and has paid the previous
year all taxes on property in the State assessed
at $300 or more.</p>

<p>Tennessee requires that a voter shall have
paid his poll-tax for the preceding year. Vermont
excludes from the suffrage “those who
have not obtained the approbation of the local
board of civil authority.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s qualification for registration is as
follows, until 1904: “First, a person who,
prior to the adoption of the Constitution, served
in time of war in the army or navy of the
United States or the Confederate States, or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
any State of the United States or of the Confederate
States; or, second, a son of any such person;
or, third, a person who owns property upon
which, in the year next preceding that in which
he offers to register, State taxes aggregating at
least $1 have been paid; or, fourth, a person
able to read any section of the Constitution submitted
to him by the officers of registration,
and to give a reasonable explanation of the same,
or if unable to read such section, able to understand
and give a reasonable explanation thereof
when read to him by the officers.” Those registering
prior to 1904 form a permanent roll.
After 1904 the soldier’s-son clause and the understanding
clause are done away with, and a
poll-tax must be paid.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen that Arkansas, Missouri,
South Carolina, and Tennessee require the prepayment
of a poll-tax, while Delaware requires
the payment of a registration fee of $1; that
Georgia and Pennsylvania require the prepayment
of taxes, while South Carolina, Louisiana,
and Virginia require the payment of taxes in
the alternative, another alternative being that
the voter must, in South Carolina and Louisiana,
as in California, be able to read and write,
while in Virginia, as in Mississippi, he is required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
only to be able to read or understand the
Constitution when read to him, though in Virginia
this last requirement was only for two
years; and after two years the voter must be
able to read and write.</p>

<p>Louisiana excepts those whose father or
grandfather was entitled to vote on January
1, 1867, and Virginia excepts until 1904 those
who were soldiers or seamen or whose fathers
served as soldiers or seamen in time of war.</p>

<p>Vermont, on the other hand, has the singular
requirement that the voter must “obtain the
approbation of the local board of civil authority”—a
requirement which would seem to
place the qualification wholly at the mercy of
the party in power.</p>

<p>Though the representation in Congress of
the Southern States would appear at present to
be greater than the recorded vote of those
States would entitle them to, the inequality is
by no means so real as it appears, and is not
greater than that which exists between some of
the Eastern and Western States.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>It has been well shown by the same distinguished
member of the New York Bar already
quoted that “the disparity between the Southern
States where the ignorant Negro vote has
been practically eliminated and the Eastern
States, though glaring, is less than that between
the Eastern States and some of the Western
States. For example, “Rhode Island’s vote is
1.59 times as great as Alabama’s, but South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Dakota’s is 3.39 as great as that of Rhode Island.
Vermont’s is 2.22 times as great as Florida’s,
but Utah’s is 3.01 as great as Vermont’s.
Maine’s is 2.36 as great as Georgia’s, but Colorado’s
is 3.48 times as great as Maine’s.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The figures cited fail to give the strength of
the Southern vote. The small vote in the Southern
States is due partly to the fact that the
ascendancy of one political party is so great that
voters do not feel it necessary to attend the
polls.</p>

<p>In the next place, though it was frankly admitted
that the motive of the disfranchisement
clauses was to disfranchise the ignorant colored
vote, while the ignorant white vote was admitted
for a time, provided the voters or their
fathers had been soldiers, this is but a temporary
inequality; and that the ignorant colored
vote does not come within the grandfather
clause or other saving clauses is an incident of
the time. In a comparatively short time the
effect of these saving clauses will have passed
away and the suffrage will be based on a purely
educational or property qualification.</p>

<p>A writer in <cite>The Outlook</cite> of June 13, 1903,
in an article entitled, “Negro Suffrage in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
the South,” says: “How far do they exclude
him (the Negro) in point of fact? In answering
this question the reader must note that in
three of the States, Alabama, South Carolina,
and Virginia, a Negro who possesses property
amounting in value to $300 and has paid his
taxes may vote. He may not be able to read
and write, he may not be able to understand
the Constitution when it is read to him. But
if he has had the industry, the sobriety, the
thrift which have enabled him to accumulate
taxable property to the amount of $300, he has
the ballot. How many Negroes there are in
the South who under this provision are admitted
to the ballot we have no means of knowing.
It has been estimated that the total ownings
of Negroes in the Southern States mount
up to $300,000,000 worth of personal and real
estate. It is officially reported that in Virginia
they own one-twenty-sixth of all the land in the
State. These facts would seem to indicate that
a not inconsiderable number of Negroes are
admitted to the ballot in the Southern States under
the property qualification. On the other
hand, a considerable white population has been
disfranchised under this property-qualification
clause. We are informed by a Southern correspondent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
whose means of acquaintance justify
our placing some confidence in his statement,
that in Alabama fully fifty thousand white men,
under the practical operation of the Constitution,
by non-payment of poll-taxes or other
clauses, have been disfranchised.”</p>

<p>It may also be well to consider the effect of
such a penalizing measure on the future of the
Negro himself. To adopt it would be to violate
the one principle on which the permanent
advance of the Negro race must be founded.
That is, the recognition, even at this late hour,
by the Negro that he must stand on his own
merits and is to be left to work out politically,
as well as economically, his own future. To
adopt it would mislead him into thinking he is
still the ward of the nation and is to be supported
by it, irrespective of his conduct—an
idea to which may be traced a considerable portion
of all that has retarded the Negro’s advance
in the past. It will tend to divert once
more his aim from the paths of industry to
which it is being turned by the wisest of his
friends. It will engender a new hostility to
him on the part of the stronger race, on whose
friendship his future welfare must depend.</p>

<p>Finally, should such a measure be adopted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
it might lead the whites of the South to do what
they have hitherto steadfastly refused to do—apply
the money derived by taxation on the
property of each race exclusively to the education
of that race. It has been publicly alleged
and appears to be generally assumed that the
recent election in Mississippi was in a measure
reactionary. The ground for this assumption
seems to be that the successful candidate for
the Governorship had declared himself to a certain
extent opposed to a continuance of the prevailing
system. The writer, while recognizing
the disappointing results that have followed the
large expenditure for the education of the Negroes,
would deplore immeasurably any backward
step in the matter of education in the
South. Light, however glimmering, is far better
than darkness. The present system of education
may be a poor one, but it is infinitely
better than none. Every consideration of public
policy would seem to urge its continuance
until a better system can be devised. And one
consideration would appear unanswerable. The
Negroes will always have their own leaders,
and it is better that these leaders should be enlightened
rather than ignorant. No more deplorable
disaster could befall the South than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
in this age of advancing enlightenment to
have a great pariah class hopelessly and irrevocably
ignorant established within her borders.</p>

<p>In this view he believes the great body of
thoughtful Southerners will unite. But no one
can foretell what effect on public sentiment a
crusade against the South, based on her attitude
toward the Negroes, might produce. It might
sweep away the last remnant of good feeling
that remains, and with it every dollar raised by
taxation on the property of the whites to educate
the blacks. The South is now spending on
the education of the Negro race, by voluntary
taxation of the property of the white race, over
five and one-half millions of dollars annually.
It would be a poor bargain to exchange for
the figment of a right which ignorance should
never have had, the remaining good-will of the
Whites of the South and the sum they annually
expend from their own pockets in trying to
uplift the Negro and fit him for the exercise of
that right.</p>

<p>It is the conviction of the writer, and he gives
it for what it is worth, that the disfranchisement
of the main body of the Negro race in
the Southern States was a measure of high necessity.
He further believes that this disfranchisement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
is for the permanent welfare of both
races. It removes for the time being what is
the chief cause of bitterness—a bitterness from
which the Negro is a greater sufferer than the
white. It will turn the Negro generally from
the field where, in his present condition, he has
proved a failure, and leave him to develop himself
in a field where he may be the equal of any
other man.</p>

<p>One who has been a serious and, as is generally
agreed, a profound student of our Government
and our people has recently given his
conclusions after study of conditions in the
South, and they agree substantially with the
views of the more conservative element of the
Southern whites.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Mr. James Bryce declares,
“that those who rule subject Races on despotic
methods ... do not realize all the difficulties
that arise in a Democracy. The capital
instance is afforded by the history of the Southern
States since the Civil War....</p>

<p>“The moral to be drawn from the case of
the Southern States seems to be that you must
not, however excellent your intentions and however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
admirable your sentiments, legislate in the
teeth of facts. The great bulk of the Negroes
were not fit for the suffrage; nor under the
American Federal system was it possible (without
incurring other grave evils) to give them
effective protection in the exercise of the suffrage.
It would, therefore, have been better to
postpone the bestowal of this dangerous boon.
True it is that rocks and shoals were set thick
around every course; true that it is easier to perceive
the evils of a course actually taken than
to realize other evils that might have followed
some other course. Nevertheless, the general
opinion of dispassionate men has come to deem
the action taken in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, 1870, a mistake.</p>

<p>“The social relations of two Races which
cannot be fused raise problems even more difficult,
because incapable of being regulated by
law....</p>

<p>“The tremendous problem presented by the
Southern States of America, and the likelihood
that similar problems will have to be solved
elsewhere, as, for instance, in South Africa and
the Philippine Isles, bid us ask, What should
be the duty and the policy of a dominant Race
where it cannot fuse with a backward Race?
Duty and policy are one, for it is equally to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the interest of both Races that their relations
should be friendly.</p>

<p>“The answer seems to be that as regards
political rights, Race and blood should not be
made the ground of discrimination. Where the
bulk of the colored Race are obviously unfit for
political power, a qualification based on property
and education might be established which
should permit the upper section of that Race
to enjoy the suffrage. Such a qualification would
doubtless exclude some of the poorest and most
ignorant whites, and might on that ground be
resisted. But it is better to face this difficulty
than to wound and alienate the whole of the
colored Race by placing them without the pale
of civic functions and duties.”</p>

<p>One of the fundamental errors has been in
considering the Negroes as a special class, to
be regarded, discussed, legislated for, aided, and
sustained as such, instead of as plain human
beings who, judged according to certain universal
standards, belong to various classes in which
those standards would place other members of
the human family. This was the fundamental
error of the doctrinaire in the first instance,
and, unfortunately, the Negroes themselves have
gotten the idea so firmly fixed in their minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
that they have long regarded their race as a
special species, to be considered from quite a
special standpoint, judged by different standards,
and dealt with in a different manner from
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more unwise, because nothing
tends more to mislead the Negro as to the
future and keep up the misunderstanding which
blocks the way to a proper solution of the question.
The Negroes must learn that before they
can claim to be accorded the treatment that the
Whites receive they must themselves act along
lines which govern the conduct of the whites.</p>

<p>If a white man is a brute or a blackguard,
all whites do not feel it necessary to defend
him. If a white man commits a crime, all
whites do not conspire to shield him and aid
him in escaping the penalties of the law. If a
white man is arrested, all whites do not assail
the arresting officers; he is left to his remedy at
law. If a white man has committed rape and
murder and a mob catches and lynches him, all
white men, however they deplore and denounce
lawlessness, do not feel it necessary to declare
the miscreant innocent and a martyr.</p>

<p>A great step will be taken toward the correct
solution of the problem when the Negroes shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
be considered and shall consider themselves not
“in the lump,” but as individuals, just as any
other members of the community are considered;
not as a separate class, but as part of
various classes to which their standing morally,
mentally, and personally would assign them—when
they shall be judged by the same standards
and governed by the same rules; when the malefactor
shall be dealt with as a malefactor; the
reputable man shall be esteemed for his good
character: in other words, when every man
shall be judged on his own merits and shall
stand or fall on his own showing. This must
be the work of both races. It is what the more
enlightened Negroes say they desire; but, unfortunately,
not a great many of them appear
to act upon this. Their acts, their addresses delivered
at Afro-American meetings, their newspapers,
their writings, all tend to show that
those who claim and would appear to be the
leaders among them regard all matters wholly
from a racial standpoint. They clamor for
recognition and for assistance as Negroes; make
inflammatory speeches; call on Congress to
intervene in their behalf as such, and at times
even suggest, in case Congress does not interpose,
that an appeal be made to foreign nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>It is worth while to note that most of the
appeals, addresses, resolutions, and other clamors
that tend to stir up the Negroes in the South
come from those who are outside of her borders,
and consequently are beyond any direct
suffering from the oppression and other outrages
against which they protest. This feeling is,
therefore, entirely racial. In the main, the
Negroes in the South appear to get on fairly
well with their other fellow-citizens; and the
resolutions and addresses that emanate from
these are much more temperate and reasonable
than those which come from the outside. Compare,
for example, the addresses and resolutions
of the Negro Convention held two years
ago at Louisville with those in some of the
Northern cities.</p>

<p>A sentiment has developed in parts of the
South since the recent agitation to repeal the
Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, but this has not been strong
enough to lead to any overt, much less concerted
attempt to promote such a movement.
On the contrary, the leaders among the Southern
people have hitherto firmly opposed the suggestion
of such a measure. One reason undoubtedly
has been the practical difficulties in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
way of carrying it through; but another has
been that they have generally not wished to
exclude from the suffrage the best element
among the Negroes.</p>

<p>Personally the writer does not, under existing
conditions, believe in repealing the amendment.
He would, indeed, rather have it repealed
than have a perpetual continuance of
the evils that have resulted from unrestricted
suffrage. But he believes that these evils will
to a large extent be done away with by the new
constitutions, and he believes that, proper restrictions
being provided, the rule should be
applied impartially to all; and those individuals,
whether white or black, should be admitted to
the rights of citizenship who measure up to the
full standard of citizenship.</p>

<p>A certain element among the Negroes are
good citizens, and are becoming better citizens
all the time. When this element shall have
broken away from the false teaching which has
been their bane, they will have no need to ask
for outside aid. The South will recognize their
value, and their reward will be the clear distinction
between them and the ignorant element
which now weighs them down.</p>

<p>It has long appeared to the writer that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
prime necessity of the Negroes is to learn to
distinguish between Negroes and Negroes; between
the law-abiding and self-respecting Negro
and the lawbreaker and blackguard; between
the honest man and the thief; the decent
man and the dive-frequenter; the good citizen
and the “tough”—in other words, to create for
themselves some standard of virtue and right
living for both men and women according to
which they shall be classified. Not the least
evil of the solidifying of the Negro race during
the period of reconstruction was the destruction
of all distinctions between virtue and vice, as
a qualification for civic promotion. After thirty
years the upright, law-abiding, conservative Negro
is bound by that manacle to the thief and
the evil-liver, and strangely enough he mainly
appears unwilling to help break the shackles
which hold him down.</p>

<p>These laws give him a chance to break away
from his burden, if he but has the sense to see
it. It will tend to break up the dense solidarity
of the Negroes, and will give the best among
them—that is, the conservative, the industrious,
the thrifty, and the enlightened—an opportunity
to rise and range themselves in a class where
they will be freed from the burden of the ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
mass which weighs them down, and may
form a better class to which the others may aspire.
And this the writer esteems a supreme
necessity. It leaves open the avenue by which
all who are capable may reënter the former
field, not as Negroes who are admitted simply
as such, however feeble and dull they may be,
but as men who are admitted because they are
strong and intelligent.</p>

<p>The Negro as a race, considered and acting
solidly, may be a burden and a menace; but
many Negroes are good men and good citizens.
They contribute their part to the public wealth
and are on every ground of justice and sound
policy entitled to consideration.</p>

<p>This upper fraction of the race, relieved from
the incubus of the great body which they have
been forced to carry as it were on their backs,
would inevitably secure political representation
in the South precisely as they have secured it in
the North. They would before long probably
have the intelligence to divide upon all economic
questions just as any other race divides, and the
whites, released from the necessity of maintaining
a solidarity, would likewise be free to divide,
in which case there would always be an inducement
to secure rather than to repress the Negro
vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>A possible step in reaching the solution of
the question might be for a reasonably limited
number of representative Southern men to meet
in conference a reasonable number of those colored
men of the South who are more familiar
with actual conditions there, and thus are representative
of the most enlightened and experienced
portion of that race. These, in a spirit
of kindness and of justice, might confer together
and try to find some common ground on
which both shall stand, and formulate some
common measures as to which both sides shall
agree and which both shall advocate.</p>

<p>One guiding principle should be, that having
established a law to eliminate forthwith the ignorant
Negro and henceforth all ignorance, this
law should be administered honestly, bravely,
and impartially.</p>

<p>It is not imagined that such a conference
could settle the question, but at least it would
throw some light on it, and it would serve two
good purposes. It would be a starting point
for securing information which would command
respect, and it would show what the most
conservative and broad-minded element at the
South, both of the whites and of the blacks, who
know the subject thoroughly and have no personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
interest to subserve except that arising
from the just and reasonable settlement of this
vital problem, think of it, after they have had
the fullest means of securing information.</p>

<p>Meantime, let the politician and the doctrinaire,
if they are truly the Negro’s friends, hold
hands off. The best service the Negro’s best
friend can render him is to tell him the truth.
The direst injury the Negro’s worst enemy can
do him is to perpetuate hostility between him
and the Southern White. Left to themselves
they would settle the question along economic
lines, and this it must come to at last.</p>

<p>However one side or the other may dogmatize,
it is safe to assume that any final settlement
of the problem must be one that will commend
itself to the body of the intelligent whites at

<p>The Reconstruction Act forced through Congress in
August, 1864, by the radical wing of the Republican
Party, and vetoed by Mr. Lincoln by a pocket veto, expressly
limited the franchise to adult whites. The platform of the
Republican Party on which Lincoln was renominated and
reëlected in November, 1864, made no reference to Negro
suffrage. During this year (1864) the Union people adopted
new or amended old constitutions in Arkansas, Connecticut,
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, and Virginia, but no mention was
made of Negro suffrage except to exclude it. <em>Id.</em></p>

<p>In December, 1865, when the question of the establishment
of Negro suffrage in the District of Columbia was submitted
to the voters there, the vote stood, in Georgetown, 1
vote for and 812 votes against the measure, and in Washington,
35 votes for and 6,521 votes against the measure. <em>Id.</em>,
p. 27.</p>

<p>In September, 1865, the question was submitted to the
voters of the Territory of Colorado. The vote stood 476 for
and 4,192 against it. <em>Ib.</em></p>

<p>In June, 1866, the people of Nebraska adopted a constitution
which limited suffrage to whites. In October, 1867,
the proposition for Negro suffrage in Ohio was voted down
by over 50,000 majority. In November of that year the
people of Kansas and Minnesota “voted it down by large
majorities.” <em>Id.</em>, p. 29.</p>

<p>In November, 1868, the people of Iowa voted to strike out
the word “white” from the Constitution. In this State by
the census of 1870 there were 289,162 whites and 1,542
blacks. The vote, however, on this measure was 22,000
less than that for the Republican ticket. <em>Id.</em>, p. 39, citing
<cite>Tribune</cite> Almanac for 1869, p. 75.</p>

<p>In November, 1868, the people of Minnesota once more
voted on the measure, and this time it was carried through
by only about three-fifths of the majority given the Republican
ticket. By the census of 1870 there were in that State
114,344 adult white men and 246 adult Negro men. <em>Id.</em>, p. 40.</p>

<p>In 1868, in Missouri, the measure was voted down by
18,000 majority. <em>Ib.</em></p>

<p>In Michigan, in 1868, when the Republican Party carried
the State by nearly 32,000 majority, the question of Negro
suffrage was voted down by nearly 39,000 majority. <em>Ib.</em></p>

<p>In 1869 the people of New York defeated the proposed
measure by over 32,000 majority, and the Legislature of that
State rescinded a former act of the previous Legislature,
which had, by a majority of two, ratified the Fifteenth Amendment.
<em>Id.</em>, p. 65.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1869, in Indiana, seventeen Senators
and thirty-six Representatives resigned from the Legislature
to break a quorum and prevent the ratification of the amendment.
Every one of these, with a single exception, was subsequently
reëlected by the people. <em>Id.</em>, p. 66-7.</p>

<p>Meantime, under the “Reconstruction Acts,” the amendment
was forced on the South. Seven of the Southern
States ratified it by the Negro vote, the whites being generally
disfranchised, while in three of them—Virginia, Mississippi
and Texas—ratification was assented to as a condition
of readmission to the Union. <em>Ib.</em></p>

<span class="fs80">THE OLD-TIME NEGRO</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">That the “old-time Negro” is passing
away is one of the common sayings
all over the South, where once he
was as well known as the cotton-plant and the
oak tree. Indeed, he has become so rare that
even now when a gray and wrinkled survivor is
found he is regarded as an exceptional character,
and he will soon be as extinct as the dodo.
That he will leave a gap which can hardly be
filled is as certain as that the old-time cavalier
or the foster-father of romance has left his gap.</p>

<p>The “new issue” at which the old-time Negro,
who had been the servant and the associate
of gentlemen, once turned up his nose from his
well-secured position, and of which he spoke in
terms of scornful reprobation, has, with the
passing of time, pushed him from his stool, and
is no longer the “new issue,” but the general
type that prevails commonly—the Negro with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
his problem; a problem which it may, as has
been well said by Mr. Root, take all the wisdom,
all the forbearance, and all the resolution
of the white race to solve.</p>

<p>Some of the “Afro-Americans,” with the
veneer of a so-called education, to judge from
recent works written by certain of them, presume
to look down somewhat scornfully on this
notable development of their race, and assume
a fine scorn of the relation which once existed
all over the South between the old-time Southerner
and the old-time darky, and which still
exists where the latter still survives.</p>

<p>They do not consider that large numbers of
this class held positions of responsibility and
trust, which they discharged with a fidelity and
success that is the strongest proof of the potentiality
of the race. They do not reckon that
warm friendship which existed between master
and servant, and which more than any other
one thing gives promise of future and abiding
friendship between the races when left to settle
their relations without outside interference.</p>

<p>One going through the South now—even
through those parts where the old-time darky
was once the regular and ordinary picture—unless
he should happen to drift into some secluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
region so far out of the sweep of the
current that its life has been caught as in an
eddy, would never know what the old life had
been, and what the old-time Negroes were in
that life. Their memory is still cherished in
the hearts of those to whom they stood in a relation
which cannot be explained to and cannot
be understood by those who did not know it as
a vital part of their home-life. Even these will
soon have passed from the stage, and in another
decade or two the story of that relation,
whose roots were struck deep in the sacredest
relations of life, will be only a tradition kept
alive for a generation or two, but gradually
fading until it is quite blurred out by time.</p>

<p>Curiously, whatever the Southerners may
think of slavery—and there were many who
reprobated its existence—whatever they may
think of “the Negro” of to-day, there is
scarcely one who knew the Negro in his old relation
who does not speak of him with sympathy
and think of him with tenderness. The
writer has known men begin to discuss new conditions
fiercely, and on falling to talking of the
past, drift into reminiscences of old servants
and turn away to wipe their eyes. And not the
least part of the bitterness of the South over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
the Negro question as it has existed grows out
of resentment at the destruction of what was
once a relation of warm friendship and tender
sympathy.</p>

<p>Of African slavery it may be said that whatever
its merits and demerits, it divided this country
into two sections, with opposing interests,
and finally plunged it into a vast and terrible
war. This is condemnation enough.</p>

<p>One need not be an advocate of slavery because
he upsets ideas that have no foundation
whatever in truth and sets forth facts that can
be substantiated by the experience of thousands
who knew them at first hand.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is well known by those who knew the old
plantation-life that there were marked divisions
between the Negroes. There were among them
what might almost be termed different orders.
These were graded by the various relations
in which the individuals stood to the “white
folks”—that is, to the master and mistress and
their family.</p>

<p>The house-servants represented a class quite
distinct from and quite above the “field-hands,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
of whom they were wont to speak scornfully as
“cornfield niggers,” while among the former
were degrees as clearly defined as ever existed
in an English gentleman’s house, where the
housekeeper and the butler held themselves
above the rest of the servants, only admitting
to occasional fellowship the lady’s maid.</p>

<p>Among the first in station were the mammy,
the butler, the body-servant, the carriage-driver,
the ladies’ maids, the cook, and the gardener,
with, after an interval, the “boys” who were
attached to one or the other position as assistants
and were in training for the places when
the elders should fail. Among the “field-hands”
was, first, the “head man.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The “head man” was the equal of any other
servant—a rank due, perhaps, partly to his authority
and partly to the character that brought
him this authority. He was the foreman, or
assistant superintendent of the plantation. He
carried the keys; he called the hands to work;
directed them, and was, to some extent, in authority
over them. Such a one I knew, mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
in word and act, who towered above the hands
he led, a “head man,” indeed.</p>

<p>A somewhat inaccurate idea prevails of the
Southern plantation life, due, possibly, to the
highly colored pictures that have been painted
of it in books of a romantic order, in which
the romance much outweighed the ha’penny-worth
of verisimilitude. The current idea is
that a Southern plantation was generally a great
estate, teeming with black slaves who groaned
under the lash of the drivers and at night were
scourged to their dungeons, while their masters
revelled in ill-used luxury and steeped themselves
in licentiousness, not stopping at times
to “traffic in their own flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>It may be well to say in the outset that nothing
could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>There were great estates, but they were not
numerous. There were, possibly, a score of
persons in Virginia who owned over three hundred
slaves, and ten or a dozen who owned
over five hundred. Such estates were kept up
in a certain style which almost always accompanies
large wealth. But the great majority
of the plantations in Virginia, and, so far as
my reading and observation have gone, elsewhere,
however extensive were the lands, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
modest and simple, and the relation between
masters and servants was one of close personal
acquaintance and friendliness, beginning at the
cradle and scarcely ending at the grave.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war, while the number
of the white population of the Southern
States was about thirteen millions, the number
of slave-owners and slave-hirers, including those
who owned or hired but one slave, was, perhaps,
less than half a million; that is, of the
adult whites, men and women, estimating them
as one-fifth each of the population, less than
one in ten owned or hired slaves.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Thus, while slavery on the great plantations,
where the slaves numbered several hundreds,
was liable to such abuses as spring readily from
absenteeism, on most of the plantations the
slaves and the masters were necessarily brought
into fairly close contact, and the result of this
contact was the relation of friendship which has
been the wonder and the mystification of those
who considered slavery the sum of all the villainies.</p>

<p>The chief idea that prevails as to the relation
is taken from a work of fiction which, as a political
pamphlet written under the stress of deep
feeling, whatever truth it had as basis, certainly
does not present a true picture.</p>

<p>Work was parcelled out among the “hands,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the “hands” being divided into sections: pough-hands,
drivers, hoe-hands, etc.</p>

<p>Their homes were known as “the quarters.”
On the larger plantations they were divided by
streets.</p>

<p>On the plantation which the writer knew
best, there were several double-cabins on the
quarters-hill and three or four facing on the
backyard. In one of the latter was a room
which was the joy of his heart, and which, after
forty years, is still touched with a light more
radiant than many a palace apartment he has
seen. It was known as “Unc’ Balla’s room,”
and its occupant was so great a man to me that
in his own field I have never known his superior.
“Uncle Balla” was the carriage-driver, and
not from Jehu down was ever one who, in the
writer’s mind, could equal him in handling the
reins. He was the guide, philosopher, and
friend of my boyhood. And no better, saner, or
more right-minded guide ever lived.</p>

<p>In that room were “chists,” which I even
now think of with an indrawing of the breath,
as I imagine their precious and unexplored contents.
Verily, they must have held golden ingots!
Then, there was his cobbler’s bench, for
he was a harness-maker and cobbler—and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
cooper’s bench, for he made the noggins and
piggins and pails for the milkmaids and housewives,
deriving therefrom a little income. And
when it came to horses! As I have sat and
heard the learned at races and horse-shows air
their knowledge, I have often been filled with
a sudden longing that Uncle Balla were there
to show what real knowledge was.</p>

<p>He lived for thirty years after the war in a
little house on the edge of the plantation, and
when he began to fail he was brought home,
where he could be better looked after. At the
end, his funeral services were conducted from
the front portico and he was followed to the
grave by white and black.</p>

<p>Each cabin had, or might have had, its little
yard and garden, and each family had its
chicken-house and yard.</p>

<p>On the larger plantations, where the Negroes
numbered two hundred or more, nearly everything
was made by them, so that such an estate
was a little world in itself, substantially self-supporting.
On our place, while the spinning
and weaving and the carpentry-work were done
on the place, most of the cloth for clothing and
the shoes were bought in town in the spring
and autumn, and the tailor and cobbler kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
them in order. In purchasing the shoes, each
person brought his measure, a stick the exact
length of his foot. This stick had certain
marks or notches on it, and the Negro kept a
duplicate, by which to identify his shoes when
they arrived.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>No servants or retainers of any race ever
identified themselves more fully with their masters.
The relation was rather that of retainers
than of slaves. It began in the infancy of both
master and servant, grew with their growth,
and continued through life. Such a relation
does not now, so far as I know, exist, except
in the isolated instances of old families who
have survived all the chances and changes with
the old family servants still hanging on. Certainly,
I think, it did not exist anywhere else,
unless, perhaps, on the country estates of the
gentry in England and, possibly, in parts of
France and Germany.</p>

<p>This relation in the South was not exceptional.
It was the general, if not the universal
rule. The servants were “my servants” or
“my people”; the masters were to the servants,
“<em>my</em> master and <em>my</em> mistis,” or “my white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
folks.” Both pride and affection spoke in that
claim.</p>

<p>In fact, the ties of pride were such that it
was often remarked that the affection of the
slaves was stronger toward the whites than
toward their own offspring. This fact, which
cannot be successfully disputed, has been referred
by Professor Shaler to a survival of a
tribal instinct which preponderated over the
family instinct. Others may possibly refer it
to the fact that the family instinct was, owing
to the very nature of the institution of slavery,
not allowed to take deep root. Whatever the
cause, it does not appear even now to have
taken much root, at least, according to the
standard of the Anglo-Saxon, a race whose history
is founded upon the family instinct.</p>

<p>The family ties among the Negroes often appear
to be scarcely as strong now as they were
under the institution of slavery. Marital fidelity
is, if we are to believe those who have had
good opportunities of observation, not as common
now as it was then. The instances of desertion
of husbands, of wives, of parents, or children
would possibly offset any division that took
place under that institution.</p>

<p>A number of old Negroes whom I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
known have been abandoned by nearly all of
their children. Often, when they grow up, they
leave them with scarcely less unconcern than do
any order of the lower animals.</p>

<p>The oldest son of our dining-room servant
went off at the time of one of Sheridan’s raids
and was never heard of again until some twenty
years after the war, when it was learned that
he was a fisherman on the lower James, and
although he lived, and may be living yet, within
a hundred miles of his old home, where his
father and mother lived, he never took the
trouble even to communicate with them once.
The next son went off to the South after the
war, and the only time that he ever wrote home,
so far as I know, was when he wrote to ascertain
his age, in order that he might qualify to
vote. The same may be said of many others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Mammy was, perhaps, the most important
of the servants, as she was also the closest
intimate of the family. She was, indeed, an
actual member of the household. She was usually
selected in her youth to be the companion
of the children by reason of her being the child
of some favored servant and, as such, likely to
possess sense, amiability, judgment, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
qualities which gave promise of character and
efficiency. So she grew up in intercourse with
the girls of the family, and when they married
she became, in turn, the nurse and assistant to
the old mammy, and then the mammy of her
young mistress’s children, and, after, of their
children.</p>

<p>She has never been adequately described.
Chiefly, I fancy, because it was impossible to
describe her as she was.</p>

<p>Who may picture a mother? We may dab
and dab at it, but when we have done our best
we know that we have stuck on a little paint,
and the eternal verity stands forth like the eternal
verity of the Holy Mother, outside our
conception, only to be apprehended in our highest
moments, and never to be truly pictured by
pen or pencil.</p>

<p>So, no one can describe what the Mammy
was, and only those can apprehend her who
were rocked on her generous bosom, slept on
her bed, fed at her table, were directed and
controlled by her, watched by her unsleeping
eye, and led by her precept in the way of truth,
justice, and humanity.</p>

<p>She was far more than a servant. She was
a member of the family in high standing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
of unquestioned influence. She was her mistress’s
coadjutress and her wise adviser, and
where the children were concerned, she was next
to her in authority.</p>

<p>My father’s mammy, old Krenda, was said
to have been an African princess, and whether
there was any other foundation for the idea
than her commanding presence and character,
I know not; but these were unquestionable.
Her aphorisms have been handed down in the
family since her time. Among them was one
which has a smack of the old times and at least
indicates that she had not visited some modern
cities: “Good manners will cyah you whar
money won’t.”</p>

<p>I remember my mammy well, though she
died when I was a child. Her name was Lydia,
and she was the daughter of old Betty, who
had been my great-grandmother’s maid. Betty
used to read to her mistress during the latter
years of her life when she was blind. Lydia
had been my mother’s mammy before she was
mine and my brother’s, and she had the authority
and prestige of having been such.</p>

<p>After forty-five years, I recall with mingled
affection and awe my mammy’s dignity, force,
and kindness; her snowy bed, where I was put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
to sleep in the little up-stairs room, sealed with
pictures from the illustrated papers and with
fashion-plates, in which her artistic feeling
found its vent; I recall also the delicious “biscuit-bread”
she made, which we thought better
than that of all the cooks and bakers in the
world. In one corner stood her tea-table, with
her “tea-things,” her tea and white sugar.</p>

<p>I remember, too, the exercise of her authority,
and recall, at least two “good whippings”
that she gave me.</p>

<p>One curious recollection that remains is
of a discussion between her and one of her
young mistresses on the subject of slavery, in
which the latter fell back on what is, possibly,
one of the strongest arguments of the slave-holder,
the Bible, and asserted that God had
put each of them in their places. It may be
left to the reader to say which had the better
of the argument. The interest of the matter
now is rather academic than practical.</p>

<p>A few days before my mammy’s death she
made her will, dividing her “things,” for such
wills were as strictly observed as if they had
been admitted to probate. Among her bequests
her feather-bed and pillows were left to my
elder brother. She made my mother bring a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
pen and write his name on the bed and pillows.
And these pillows are now in his rectory.</p>

<p>It was from our mammies that we learned
those delightful stories of “Brer Fox” and
“Brer Hyah,” which the children of a later
generation have learned through the magic pen
of “Uncle Remus.” It was from them also
that we learned many of the lessons of morality
and truth.</p>

<p>Next to the mammy in point of dignity was,
of right, the butler. He held much the same
position that is held by the butler in English
houses. He was a person in authority, and he
looked that every inch. He had his ideas, and
they usually prevailed. He was the governor
of the young children, the mentor of the young
men, and their counsellor even after they had
grown up.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may have seen in some
hotel a Negro head-waiter who was a model
of dignity and of grave authority—a field-marshal
in ebony—doing the honors of his dining-room
like a court chamberlain, and ruling his
subordinates with the authority of a benignant
despot. Such a one was probably some gentleman’s
butler, who had risen by his abilities to be
the chief of the dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>More than one such character rises before
me from the past, and the stories of their authority
are a part of the traditional record of
every family. The most imposing one that I
personally remember was “Uncle Tom,” the
butler of a cousin, whose stateliness impressed
my childhood’s fancy in a way which has never
been effaced. I have seen monarchs less impressive.
His authority was so well recognized
that he used to be called in to make the children
take their physic.</p>

<p>It was said that one of the children, who is
now a matron of great dignity and a grandmother,
once, in an awed whisper, asked her
grandmother, who was the mistress of “Uncle
Tom” and of several hundred other servants,
“Gran’ma, is you feared o’ Unc’ Tom?” And
her grandmother, who told the story, used to
add: “And you know the truth is, I am.”</p>

<p>It was a cousin of hers, Mrs. Carter, of Shirley,
who used to say that when she invited company
she always had to break it to Clarissy, her
maid.</p>

<p>In truth, whatever limitation there was on
the unstinted hospitality of the South was due
to the fact that the servants were always considered
in such matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>This awe of the butler in his grandeur often
did not pass away with youth. He both demanded
and received his due respect even from
grown members of the family. Of one that I
knew it is told now by gray-headed men how,
on occasion, long after they were grown, he
would correct their manners, even at table, by
a little rap on the head and a whispered reproof,
as he leaned over them to place a dish.
And I never knew one who did not retain his
position of influence and exercise his right of
admonition.</p>

<p>I have known butlers to take upon themselves
the responsibility of saying what young gentlemen
should be admitted as visitors at the house,
and to whom the ladies should be denied. In
fact, every wise young man used to be at pains
to make friends with the old servants, for they
were a sagacious class and their influence in the
household was not inconsiderable. They had
an intuitive knowledge, which amounted to an
instinct, for “winnowing the grain from the
chaff,” and they knew a “gent’man” at sight.
Their acute and caustic comments have wrecked
the chances of many an aspiring young suitor
who failed to meet with their approval.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>There is a universal belief that the Negroes
under slavery had no education. I have seen
it stated a number of times that it was made a
crime by law, in every State of the South, to
teach one to read. Such a statement is not true.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Teaching them was not encouraged, generally,
and such laws existed at one time in four of
the States of the South; but they did not
exist in Virginia. Several of our Negroes could
read, and if it was not the same on most of
the plantations, it was at least the same on
those of which I had any knowledge. My great-grandmother’s
maid used, I have heard, to read
to her regularly, and in our family the ladies
used to teach the girls as much as they would
learn. But apart from book-learning, they had,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
especially the house-servants, the education
which comes from daily association with people
of culture, and it was an education not to be
despised. Some gentlemen carried on a correspondence
about home affairs with their butlers
during their absence from home. For instance,
I recall hearing that when Mr. Abel
P. Upshur was Secretary of the Navy, some
gentlemen were at his house, and were discussing
at table some public matter, when the butler
gave them the latest news about it, saying that
he had that morning received a letter from his
master.</p>

<p>There is an idea that the Negroes were in the
state of excitement and agonized expectancy of
freedom that the Anglo-Saxon race felt it would
have been in under similar circumstances.
Much is made, at certain kinds of meetings, of
the great part which they contributed toward
saving the Union. Discussion of this may be set
aside as bordering on the controversial. But it
may not be outside of this phase of the matter,
and it will throw some light on it to state briefly
what was the attitude of the Negro slave population
toward the quarrel between the North
and the South.</p>

<p>The total number of Negro enlistments and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
reënlistments on the Federal side was between
189,000 and 190,000. When it is considered
that this embraced all the soldier element of
the Negroes in the North and of the refugee
element in the South, who were induced to
enter the army, either by persuasion of bounties
or under stress of compulsion, whether
of military draft or of “belly-pinching,” the
number does not appear large. After midsummer,
1863, the North occupied the States of
Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, half of Virginia,
of Tennessee, of Louisiana, of Arkansas,
of Mississippi, and considerable portions of the
Carolinas and Alabamas. That is, she occupied
a third, and nearer a half, of the entire
slave-holding territory of the South, while the
penetration of her raiding parties into the regions
occupied by the Southern troops furnished,
at times, opportunity to, possibly, a
fourth of the young men of that section to escape
from bondage had they been moved by
the passion of freedom. It is at once a refutation
of the charge of the cruelty of slavery, so
commonly accepted, and an evidence of the
easy-going amiability and docility of the Negro
race that, under all the excitement and
through all the opportunities and temptations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
surrounding them, they should not only have
remained faithful to their masters, but that the
stress of the time should have appeared to weld
the bond between them.</p>

<p>That there was a wild and adventurous element
among them is well known. It was to
be expected, and was an element in whom the
instincts of wild life in the jungle and the forests
survived. Every large plantation had one
or more who had the runaway spirit keenly
alive. There were several on our place. They
ran away when they were crossed in love or
in any other desire of their hearts. They ran
away if they were whipped, and, as they were
the shirkers and loafers on the plantations, if
anyone was whipped, it was likely to be one
of them. Yet, curiously enough, if a runaway
was caught and was whipped, he was very unlikely
to run off again until the spirit seized
him, when nothing on earth could stop him.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>One other class was likely to furnish the element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
that went off, and this was the “pampered
class.” House-servants were more likely to go
than field-hands. Their ears were somehow
more attuned to the song of the siren.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Against those who availed themselves of the
opportunities offered them to escape from the
bondage of domestic slavery may be put the
great body of the Negro race who, whether
from inability to grasp the vastness of the boon
of liberty held out to them, or from fear of
the ills they knew not of, or from sheer content
with a life where the toil was not drudgery
and the flesh-pots overbalanced the idea of
freedom, not only held fast to their masters,
but took sides with them with a quickened feeling
and a deepened affection. For every one
who fled to freedom, possibly one hundred
stood by their masters’ wives and children.</p>

<p>Doubtless there were many—possibly, the
most of them—who remained from sheer inertia
or fear to leave. But a far larger number
identified themselves with their masters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
this union was not one of lip-service, but of
sentiment, of heart and soul.</p>

<p>In truth, they were infected with the same
spirit and ardor that filled the whites, and had
the South called for volunteers from the Negroes,
I question not that they could have gotten
half a million men.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>A story is told of one of the old Negroes who
belonged to the family into which General
Scott married. He went to the war to take care
of one of his young masters. He had no doubt
whatever as to the justice of the cause, but General
Scott was to his mind the embodiment of
war and carnage, and the General had espoused
the other side. This disturbed him greatly, and
one night he was heard praying down outside
the camp. After praying for everyone, he
prayed: “And O Lord, please to convut Marse
Lieutenan’ Gen’l Scott and turn him f’om de
urrer o’ he ways.”</p>

<p>The devotion of slaves to their masters in
time of war is no new thing under the sun. The
fact that their masters are in arms has always,
no doubt, borne its part in the phenomenon.
But it does not wholly account for the absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
devotion of the Negroes. It is to the eternal
credit at once of the Whites and of the Negroes
that, during these four years of war, when the
white men of the South were absent in the field
they could intrust their homes, their wives,
their children, all they possessed, to the guardianship
and care of their slaves, with absolute
confidence in their fidelity. And this trust was
never violated. The Negroes were their faithful
guardians, their sympathizing friends, and
their shrewd advisers, guarding their property,
enduring necessary denial with cheerfulness, and
identifying themselves with their masters’ fortunes
with the devotion, not of slaves, but of
clansmen.</p>

<p>The devotion of the body-servants to their
masters in the field is too well known almost
to need mention, and what is said of them in
this paper is owing rather to the feeling that
the statement of the fact is a debt due to the
class from which these came rather than to
thinking it necessary to enlighten the reader.</p>

<p>When the Southern men went into the field
there was always a contest among the Negroes
as to who should accompany them. Usually,
the choice of the young men would be for some
of the younger men among the servants, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the choice of the family would be for some of
the older and more staid members of the household,
who would be prudent, and so, more
likely to take better care of their masters. And
thus there was much heart-burning among the
younger Negroes, who were almost as eager
for adventure as their masters.</p>

<p>Of all the thousands of Negroes who went
out as servants with their masters, I have never
heard of one who deserted to the North, and
I have known of many who had abundant opportunity
to do so. Some were captured, but
escaped; others apparently deserted, but returned
laden with spoils.</p>

<p>My father’s body-servant, Ralph Woodson,
served with him throughout the entire war.
While at Petersburg, where the armies were
within a mile of each other, he was punished
for getting drunk and he ran away. But instead
of making for the Union lines and surrendering
to a Union picket, which he could easily
have done, he started for home, sixty miles
away. He was, however, arrested as a straggler
or runaway, and my father, hearing of
him, sent and brought him back to camp, where
he remained to the end.</p>

<p>An even more notable instance which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
come to my knowledge was that of Simon, the
servant of a friend of mine. He disappeared
from camp during the Spottsylvania campaign,
and just when his master had given him up he
reappeared with a sack full of all sorts of things,
useful for the mess, which he declared “dem
gent’mens on the other side had gin him.” He
had borrowed of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The letters and annals of the time are full of
references to the singular, but then well-known
fact, that while the people of the South gave
their sons joyfully to the cause, they were most
unwilling to allow their Negroes to go. The
reason for this has been much misapprehended.
It has been generally supposed outside that it
was because they were afraid to lose their property.
Nothing could be more unfounded.
They were afraid their servants might be hurt
or suffer some harm.</p>

<p>Fathers who wrote their sons to be always
at the post of honor, would give them explicit
directions how to keep their servants out of
danger. The war in some way was concerned
with the perpetuation of slavery, and it was
felt that it was not just to expose slaves to danger
when such was the case.</p>

<p>Something of this same feeling played its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
part in the decision not to enlist Negroes in the
army of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>In the field they showed both courage and
sagacity, and many are the instances in which,
when their masters were wounded and left on
the field, they hunted for them through scenes
which tested men’s courage as much as the battle
itself. The records of the time are full of such
instances.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When the war closed and the Negroes were
set free, the feeling between them and their old
masters was never warmer, the bonds of friendship
were never more close. The devotion
which the Negro had shown during the long
struggle had created a profound impression on
the minds of the Southern whites. Even between
the Negroes and poorer whites, who had
always been rather at enmity, a better feeling
had grown up. The close of the war had accomplished
what all the emancipation proclamations
could not effect. Their masters universally
informed their servants that they were
free.</p>

<p>I remember my father’s return from Appomattox.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
For days he had been watched for.
Appomattox was less than a hundred miles
from our home. The news of the surrender
had come to us first through one of the wagon-drivers,
who told it weeping. I seem to see
the return now—my father on his gray horse,
with his body-servant, Ralph, behind him. I
remember the way in which, as he slipped from
his horse, he put his hand over his face to hide
his tears, and his groan, “I never expected to
come home so.” All were weeping. A few
minutes later he came out on the porch and said:
“Ralph, you are free; take the saddles off and
turn the horses out.”</p>

<p>He had carried a silver half-dollar all
through the war, saving it till the last pinch.
This had come when he reached the river on
his way home. The ferryman had declined to
take Confederate money, and he paid him his
half-dollar to ferry him across.</p>

<p>Such was the end of slavery, the institution
which had divided this country in twain, and
finally had convulsed it and brought on a terrible
war.</p>

<p>When the end of slavery came there was,
doubtless, some heart-burning, but the transition
was accomplished without an outbreak, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
well-nigh without one act of harshness or even
of rudeness.</p>

<p>If there was jubilation among the Negroes
on the plantation it was not known to the
Whites. In fact the Negroes were rather mystified.
The sudden coming of that for which
they had possibly hoped, with the loom of the
unknown future, had sobered at least the elders.
Their owners, almost without exception, conveyed
to them the information of their freedom,
which thus had a more comprehensible
security than could have been given by the
acts of Congress, or the orders of military authorities.</p>

<p>In some cases the old Negroes sought and
held long conferences with their mistresses or
masters in which the whole matter was canvassed.</p>

<p>In every instance the assurance was given
them that they should live on the old plantations,
if they wished to do so and were still
willing to work and would obey orders.</p>

<p>As was natural, the Negroes, in the first flush
of freedom, left the estates and went off “for
themselves,” as the phrase ran.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> They flocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
either to the cities, or to the nearest centre where
a garrison of Union troops was posted, and
where rations were distributed partly as a measure
of necessity and partly from a philanthropic
sentiment which had more or less ground for
its existence. But after a time, many of them
returned to work. Those of them who had anything
shared what they had with their masters.
Some of them brought eggs and chickens; others
saved a part of the rations given by the Government.</p>

<p>It is no part of my intention in this paper to
go generally into the relation of the two races
since the emancipation of the Negroes. Certain
phases of this relation have been dealt with by
me elsewhere. While it is easy to see what
mistakes have been made in dealing with the
subject, no one can tell with any assurance
how a different system might have worked
out. All we can say, with absolute certainty,
is that hardly any other system could have
been more disastrous than the one which was
adopted.</p>

<p>One fact, I think, cannot be soundly controverted—that
the estrangement of the Negro
from the white race in the South is the greatest
misfortune that has befallen the former in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
history, not excepting his ravishment from his
native land.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The old-time Negro has almost quite passed
from the earth, as have his old master and his
old mistress. A few still remain, like the last
leaves on the tree, but in no long time they, too,
will have disappeared. But so long as he survives,
the old family feeling of affection will remain
in the hearts of those who knew him. Every
week or two the newspapers contain the
mention of the passing from the stage of one
or more of those whose place in some old family
made them notable in their lives and
caused them to be followed to the grave by as
sincere mourners among the whites as among
the blacks. But how many of them pass without
any other notice than the unfeigned mourning
of those whom they loved and served so
faithfully!</p>

<p>No Southerner, whatever his feelings of antagonism
may be to the Negro race, ever meets
an old Negro man or woman without that feeling
rising in his breast which one experiences
when he meets some old friend of his youth on
whom Time has laid his chastening hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Nor has the old feeling by any means died
out in the breast of the old Negro himself.
Only as the whites look on the young blacks
with some disapproval, so the old Negro regards
the younger generation of whites as
inferior to the generation he knew.</p>

<p>Not long since a friend in Richmond told
me the following story: A friend of his in
that city invited him in the shooting season
to go down to his father’s place to shoot partridges.
The house had been burned down,
but old Robin was still living there, and had
told him not long before that there were a
good many birds on the place. Accordingly,
the two gentlemen one morning took their guns
and dogs and drove down to the old Ball plantation,
where they arrived about sunrise. Old
Robin was cutting wood in front of his cabin,
and my friend began to shout for him: “Oh,
Robin! Oh, Robin!” The old fellow
stopped, and coming to the brow of the hill
above them, called: “Who dat know me so
much bettuh den I know him?”</p>

<p>“Come down here!” called his master.</p>

<p>When the old fellow discovered who it was
he was delighted.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” said he; “dyah’s plenty of buds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
down here on de branch. I sees ’em eve’y
evenin’ most when I comes down atter my cow.
You go ’long and kill ’em and I’ll take keer
of yo’ horse for yo’ and tell Mandy to hev some
snack for yo’ ’bout twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>Just as he was leaving, he stopped, and leaning
out of the wagon, said: “Marse Gus, don’t
yo’ shoot any ole hyahs down dere. I takes my
gun down wid me when I goes down atter my
cow. Dem buds flies too fas’ for me, but I
kin manage to shoot a ole hyah if I ketch one
settin’ in de baid.”</p>

<p>The promise was given and was kept by the
hunters until they were about to stop for lunch.
Just then a fine hare jumped up in front of
Marse Gus, and gave him a fair shot. In his
ardor he fired at it and knocked it over. At
that moment old Robin was heard calling to
them to come on up to the house as “snack was
ready.”</p>

<p>“There!” said Gus, as he picked up the
hare, “now I’ve gone and killed this hare, and
that old man will never forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Take it and give it to him for his wife,”
said his friend.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” he said, “you don’t know old
Robin; he will never forgive me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Well, put it down in the bottom of your
game-bag; he will never know the difference,”
said his friend. And this was shamelessly done.</p>

<p>They were greeted by the old man cheerfully,
with “You must have got plenty of buds,
I heard you shoot so much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we had very good luck!” said the
huntsmen.</p>

<p>“You didn’t shoot any ole hyahs?” he inquired
confidently.</p>

<p>The silence aroused his suspicion, and, turning,
he shot a keen glance at his master, which
took in the well-filled game-bag.</p>

<p>“What you got in dem game-pockets to
make ’em look so big? You certain’y ain’ shoot
as many buds as dat in dis time?”</p>

<p>Gus, convicted, poked his hand into his bag
and drew out the rabbit.</p>

<p>“Here, Uncle Robin,” he said in some confusion,
“this is the only one I shot. I want
you to take it and give it to Mandy.”</p>

<p>But the old man declined. “Nor, I don’
want it and Mandy don’ want it,” he said, half-scornfully;
“you done shoot it and now yo’ better
keep it.”</p>

<p>He stalked on up the hill in silence. Suddenly,
stopping, he turned back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said, “times certain’y is
changed! Marse Gus, yo’ pa wouldn’t ’a’ told
me a lie for a mule, let ’lone a’ ole hyah.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The character of the old-time Negro can
hardly be better illustrated than by the case of
an old friend of mine, John Dabney, to whom I,
in common with nearly all my acquaintances in
Richmond, used to be greatly indebted, for he
was the best caterer I ever knew. John Dabney
was, in his boyhood, a race-rider for a
noted Virginia turfman, Major William R.
Johnson, but, possibly because of his gifts as a
cook, he soon grew too fat for that “lean and
hungry” calling, and in time he became a celebrated
cook and caterer. He belonged to
a lady in the adjoining county to my native
county, and, prior to the war, he bought himself
from his mistress, as was not infrequently
done by clever Negroes. When the war closed,
he still owed his mistress several hundred dollars
on account of this debt, and as soon as
he was able to raise the sum he sent it to
her. She promptly returned it, telling him
that he was free and would have been free anyhow
and that he owed her nothing. On this,
John Dabney took the money, went to his old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
home and insisted on her receiving it, saying
that his old master had brought him up to pay
his debts, and that this was a just debt which
he proposed to pay. And pay it he did.</p>

<p>The instances are not rare in which old family
servants who have worked under the new
conditions more successfully than their former
owners, have shown the old feeling by rendering
them such acts of kindness as could only
have sprung from a deep and abiding affection.</p>

<p>Whoever goes to the White House will find
at the door of the executive offices an elderly
and very stout Negro door-keeper, with perfect
manners, a step as soft as the fall of the leaf,
and an aplomb which nothing can disturb. His
name is Arthur Simmons, and, until toward the
close of the war, he was a gentleman’s servant
in North Carolina; then he came North. He
is, possibly, the oldest employee in the White
House, having been appointed by General
Grant during his first term, and having held
his position, with the exception of a single term—that
of General Harrison—to the present
time. It is said that Mr. Cleveland’s first appointment
after his return to office was that of
Arthur Simmons to his old post. Possibly, Mr.
Cleveland had heard this story of him: Once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Arthur, having learned that his old mistress
had expressed a desire to see the President of
the United States, invited her to Washington,
met her at the station, saw to her comfort while
in the city, arranged an interview with the President
for her, and then escorted her back to take
her train home.</p>

<p>On a part of the old plantation which I have
attempted to describe has lived for the past
thirty years, free of rent, the leading Negro
politician in the upper end of Hanover County.
His wife, Hannah, was my mother’s old maid,
who, after the war, as before it, served us with
a fidelity and zeal of which I can give no conception.
It may, however, illustrate it to state
that, although she lived a mile and a quarter
from the house and had to cross a creek,
through which, in times of high water, she occasionally
had to wade almost to her waist, she
for thirty years did not miss being at her post
in the morning more than a half-score times.</p>

<p>Hannah has gone to her long home, and it
may throw some light on the old relation between
mistress and servant to say that on the
occasion of the golden wedding of her old master
and mistress, as Hannah was at that time too
ill to leave her home, they took all the presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
in the carriage and carried them over to show
them to her. Indeed, Hannah’s last thought
was of her old mistress. She died suddenly
one morning, and just before her death she
said to her husband, “Open the do’, it’s Miss
——.” The door was opened, but the mistress
was not there, except to Hannah’s dying gaze.
To her, she was standing by her bedside, and
her last words were addressed to her.</p>

<p>It is a continual cause of surprise among
those who do not know the South intimately
that Southerners should be so fond of the old
Negroes and yet should be so intolerant of
things which Northerners would regard with
indifference. It is a matter which can hardly
be explained, but if anyone goes and lives at
the South, he will quickly find himself falling
into Southern ways. Let one go on the plantations
where the politician is absent and the
“bloody-shirt” newspaper is unknown, and he
will find something of the old relation still existing.</p>

<p>I have seen a young man (who happened to
be a lieutenant in a volunteer company) kiss
his old mammy on the parade ground in sight
of the whole regiment.</p>

<p>Some years ago, while General Fitzhugh Lee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
was Governor of Virginia, a wedding took place
in the executive mansion at Richmond. At the
last moment, when the company were assembled
and all had taken their places, waiting for
the bride to appear, it was discovered that
mammy Celia, the bride’s mammy, had not
come in, and no less a person than General Lee,
the Governor of Virginia, went and fetched her
in on his arm to take her place beside the mother
of the bride.</p>

<p>Unhappily, whatever the future may produce,
the teachings of doctrinaires and injudicious
friends have lost the Negroes of the present
generation their manners and cost them
much of the friendship of the Whites.</p>

<p>None of us knows what relation the future
may produce between the two races in the
South, but possibly when the self-righteous shall
be fewer than they are now and the teachings
which have estranged the races shall become
more sane, the great Anglo-Saxon race, which
is dominant, and the Negro race, which is amiable,
if not subservient, will adjust their differences
more in accordance with the laws which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
must eventually prevail, and the old feeling of
kindliness, which seems, under the stress of antagonism,
to be dying away, will once more
reassert itself.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">TO any calm observer of the present
condition of our country painfully
apparent must be the difference between
the state of what from long usage we are
accustomed to term “the two sections.”</p>

<p>We have one blood, one language, one religion,
one common end, one government; but the
North and the South are still “the two sections,”
as they were one hundred years ago,
when the bands of the Constitution were hardly
cooled from the welding, or as they were in
1860, when they stood, armed to the teeth, facing
each other, and the cloud of revolution was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
hovering above them soon to burst in the dread
thunder of civil war.</p>

<p>Should one, hearing the phrase “the two sections,”
take the map of the American Union and
study its salient features, he would declare that
“the two sections” were by natural geographical
division the East and the West; should he
study the commerce of the country with its vast
currents and tides, its fields of agriculture and
manufacture, he would be impelled to declare
that by all the inexorable laws of interest they
were the East and the West. And yet, we who
stand amid the incontestable evidences of events
know that against all laws, against all reason,
against all right, there are two sections of this
country, and they are not the East and the West,
but the South and the rest of the Union.</p>

<p>It is proposed to show briefly why this unhappy
condition exists; and to suggest a few
things which, if earnestly considered and patiently
advocated, may, in the providence of
God, contribute to the solution of the distressing
difficulties which confront us.</p>

<p>The divergence of the “two sections” was
coeval with the planting of the continent; it
preceded the establishment of the nation. It
steadily increased until an irrepressible conflict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
became inevitable; and it was not until after
this conflict had spent itself that reconcilement
became possible.</p>

<p>The causes of that divergence, with the exception
of one, it is not necessary to discuss
here. This one has survived even the cauterization
of war. Other causes have passed away.
The right of secession is no longer an active
issue. It has been adjudicated. That it once
existed and was utilized on occasion by other
States than those which actually exercised it is
undeniable; that it passed away with the Confederate
armies at Appomattox is equally beyond
controversy. The very men who once
asserted it and shed their blood to establish it,
would now, while still standing by the rightness
of their former position, admit that in the light
of altered conditions the Union is no longer dissoluble.
They are ready if need be to maintain
the fact. It is, however, important to make it
clear that the right did exist, because on this
depends largely the South’s place in history.
Without this we were mere insurgents and rebels;
with it, we were a great people in revolution
for our rights. In 1861 the South stood aligned
against the Union and apparently for the perpetuation
of slavery. The sentiment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
whole world was against it. We were defeated,
overwhelmed. Unless we possess strength sufficient
to maintain ourselves even in the face of
this, the verdict of posterity will be against us.
It is not unlikely that in fifty years the defence
of slavery will be deemed the world over to
have been as barbarous as we now deem the
slave-trade to have been. There is but one way
to prevent the impending disaster: by establishing
the real fact, that, whatever may have
been the immediate and apparent occasion, the
true and ultimate cause of the action of the
South was her firm and unwavering adherence
to the principle of self-government and her
jealous devotion to her inalienable rights.</p>

<p>But if the other causes which kept the country
divided have passed away as practical issues,
one still survives and is, under a changed form,
as vital to-day and as pregnant with evil as it
was in 1861.</p>

<p>This is the question which ever confronts the
South; the question which after twenty-five
years of peace and prosperity still keeps the
South “one section” and the rest of the nation
the other. This is the ever-present, ever-menacing,
ever-growing Negro Question.</p>

<p>It is to-day the most portentous as it is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
most dangerous problem which confronts the
American people.</p>

<p>The question is so misunderstood that even
the terminology for it in the two sections varies
irreconcilably. The North terms it simply the
question of the civil equality of all citizens before
the law; the South denominates it the question
of Negro domination. More accurately it
should be termed the Race Question.</p>

<p>Whatever its proper title may be, upon its
correct solution depend the progress and the security,
if not the very existence, of the American
people.</p>

<p>In order that it may be solved it is necessary,
first, that its real gravity shall be understood,
and its true difficulties apprehended.</p>

<p>We have lived in quietude so long, and have
become so accustomed to the condition of affairs,
that we are sensible of no apprehension,
but rest in the face of this as of other dangers,
content and calm. So rest Alpine dwellers who
sleep beneath masses of snow which have accumulated
for years, yet which, quiet as they
appear upon the mountain-sides above, may at
any time without warning, by the mere breaking
of a twig or the fall of a pebble, be transformed
into the resistless and overwhelming avalanche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>There are signs of impending peril about us.</p>

<p>There is, first, the danger incident to the
exigence under which the South has stood, of
wresting if not of subverting the written law
to what she deems the inexorable exactions of
her condition.</p>

<p>It is often charged that the written law is
not fully and freely observed at the South in
matters relating to the exercise of the elective
franchise. The defence is not so much a denial
of the charge as it is a confession and avoidance.
To the accusation it is replied that the
written law, when subverted at all, is so subverted
only in obedience to a higher law
founded on the instinct of self-protection and
self-preservation.</p>

<p>If it be admitted that this is true, is it nothing
to us that a condition exists which necessitates
the subversion of any law? Is it not an
injury to our people that the occasion exists
which places them in conflict with the law, and
compels them to assert the existence of a higher
duty? Can law be overridden without creating
a spirit which will override law? a spirit ready
to constitute itself the judge of what shall and
what shall not be considered law; a spirit which
eventually substitutes its will for law and confounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
its interest with right? Is it a small
matter that our people or any part of them
should be compelled, by any exigency whatever,
to go armed at any time in any place in defiance
of law?</p>

<p>This is a grave matter and is to be considered
with due deliberation; for on its right solution
much depends. The first step toward cure
is ever comprehension of the disease. The first
step toward the proper solution of our trouble
is to secure a perfect comprehension of it. To
do this we must first comprehend it ourselves,
then only can we hope to enlighten others.</p>

<p>Obedience to law, willing and invariable submission
to law, is one of the highest qualities
of a nation, and one of the chief promoters of
national elevation. Antagonism to law, a spirit
which rejects the restraints of law, depraves the
individual conscience and retards national progress.</p>

<p>Can any fraud, evasion, or contrivance whatever
be practised or connived at, without by so
much impairing the moral sense and character
of a people as well as of an individual? Can
any deflection whatsoever, no matter how inexorable
the occasion, from the path of absolute
rectitude be tolerated without inflicting an injury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
on that sense of justice and right, which,
allied to unflinching courage, constitutes a nation’s
virtue? Who will say that the moral sense
of our people now is as lofty as it was in the
days of our fathers, when men voted with uplifted
faces for the candidate of their choice?</p>

<p>The press of a portion of the land is filled
with charges of injuries to the Negro. The
real injury is not to him, but to the White. From
opposition to law to actual lawlessness is but a
step. This then is the first danger.</p>

<p>The physical peril from the overcrowding
among our people of an ignorant and hostile
race is not more real than this which threatens
our moral rectitude; but it is more apparent.</p>

<p>Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, speaking on
the floor of the United States Senate on the 23d
of February, 1889, in speaking of the South,
said:</p>

<p>“I make these remarks with full knowledge
of the difficult problem that awaits us, and the
problem that especially concerns our friends
south of Mason and Dixon’s line; but I remember
when I make them that the person hears
the sound of my voice this moment who, in his
lifetime, will see fifty million Negroes dwelling
in those States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>Can language paint in stronger colors the
peril which confronts us? The senator went
on to depict the evils which might ensue. “If
you go on,” he said, “with these methods which
are reported to us on what we deem pretty
good evidence, you are sowing in the breast of
that race a seed from which is to come a harvest
of horror and blood, to which the French Revolution
or San Domingo is light in comparison.”</p>

<p>Senator Hoar, like most others of his latitude,
thinks that he knows the Negro, and
understands the pending question. He does
not. Had he understood the true gravity of
that problem, his cheek, as he caught the echo
of his own words, would have blanched at the
thought of the peril he is transmitting to his
children and grandchildren; not the peril, perhaps,
of fire and massacre, but a peril as deadly,
the peril of contamination from the overcrowding
of an inferior race. All other evils are
but corollaries; the evil of race-conflict, though
not so awful as the French Revolution or San
Domingo; the evil of growing armies with
their menace to liberty; the evil of race-degeneration
from enforced and constant association
with an inferior race: these are some of the
perils which spring from that state of affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and confront us. At one more step they confront
the rest of the Anglo-American people to-day.
For the only thing that stands to-day
between the people of the North and the Negro
is the people of the South. The time may come
when the only thing that will stand between the
Negro and the people of the North will be the
people of the South.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The chief difficulty in the solution of the
question exists in the different views held as to
it by the two sections. They do not understand
it alike. They stand as widely divided as to
it to-day as they stood forty years ago. Their
ultimate interests are identical; their present
interests are not very widely divergent. Their
opposite attitudes as to it must, therefore, be
due to error somewhere. One or the other section
must be in error as to it; possibly neither
may be exactly right.</p>

<p>This much we know and can assert: there
must be an absolutely right position. It is imperatively
necessary that we find it; for on our
discovery of it and our planting ourselves firmly
on it depends our security. If we have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
found it the sooner we realize that fact the better
for us and for those that shall come after
us; if we have found it the sooner we make it
understood the better.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, there is no security in
silence; no safety in inaction. If fifty million
Negroes, or even a much smaller number, are
to come with San Domingo and the French
Revolution in their train, the white race has
need to awake and bestir itself.</p>

<p>The recent census has happily showed that
Senator Hoar and others like him have over-estimated
the ratio of increase.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But the problem
is grave enough as it is.</p>

<p>The first step to be taken is to turn the light
on the subject. Let it be examined, measured,
comprehended, and then dealt with as shall be
found to be just and right. The old method of
crimination and defiance will no longer avail;
we must deal with the question calmly, rationally,
philosophically. We must abandon all
untenable positions whatsoever, place ourselves
on the impregnable ground of right, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
whatever may befall meantime, we can calmly
await the inevitable justification of events.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us disembarrass ourselves
by discarding all irrelevant and extraneous
questions. Putting aside all mere prejudice
whatever, whether springing from the Negro’s
former condition of servitude or from other
causes, let us base our argument on facts and
the final issue cannot be doubtful.</p>

<p>Whatever prejudice may exist, a constant,
firm, and philosophic presentation of the facts
of the case must in the end establish the truth,
and secure the right remedy. The spirit of civilization
must overcome at last, and whatever
obstacles it shall encounter, right must eventually
triumph.</p>

<p>The North deems the pending question
merely one of the enforcement or subversion of
an elective franchise law; it has never accepted
the proposition that it is a great race question
on which hinges the preservation of the Union,
the security of the people, white and black alike,
and the progress of American civilization. Perhaps
no clearer or more authoritative exposition
of the views held by the North on this question
can be found than that set forth in a recent address
by Mr. G. W. Cable delivered before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Massachusetts Club of Boston on the 22d of
February, 1890. The favor with which it was
received by the class to whom it was delivered
testifies not the hostility of that class, but the
extent to which the question is misunderstood
in that section.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable, after negativing the Southern
idea of the question, declares: “The problem
is whether American citizens shall not enjoy
equal rights in the choice of their rulers. It
is not a question of the Negro’s right to rule.
<em>It is simply a question of their right to choose
rulers; and as in reconstruction days they selected
more white men for office than men of
their own race, they would probably do so
now.</em>” This is quoted with approval by even
so liberal and well-informed a thinker as the
Rev. Henry M. Field, who certainly bears only
good-will to the South, as to the rest of mankind.
The indorsement of these views by such
a man proves that the North absolutely misapprehends
the true question which confronts
the nation at this time. It has from constant
iteration accepted as facts certain statements
such as those quoted, and these constitute its
premises, on which it bases all its reasoning and
all its action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>The trouble is that its first premise is fallacious.
Its teachers, its preachers, its writers, its
orators, its philosophers, its politicians, have
with one voice, and that a mighty voice, been
for a hundred years instilling into its mind the
uncontradicted doctrine that the South brought
the Negro here and bound him in slavery; that
the South kept the Negro in slavery; that to
perpetuate this enormity the South plunged the
nation in war, and attempted to destroy the
Union; that the South still desires the reëstablishment
of slavery, and that meantime it oppresses
the Negro, defies the North, and stands
a constant menace to the Union.</p>

<p>The great body of the Northern people, bred
on this food, never having heard any other relation,
believes this implicitly, and all the more
dangerously because honestly. If they are
wrong and we right it behooves us to enlighten
them.</p>

<p>There are, without doubt, some whom nothing
can enlighten; who would not believe though
one rose from the dead. They are not confined
to one latitude. There are, with equal certainty,
others who for place and profit trade in
their brother’s blood, and keep open the wounds
which peace, but for them, would long ago have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
healed; who for a mess of pottage would sell
the birthright of the nation. The professional
Haman can never sleep while Mordecai so
much as sits at the gate; but we can have an
abiding faith in the ultimate good sense and
sound principles of the great Anglo-Saxon race
wherever it may dwell; and to this we must
address ourselves.</p>

<p>The second thing necessary to the solution of
the question is to enlighten the people of the
North. If we can show that the question is not,
as Mr. Cable states and as the North believes,
merely whether the Negro shall or shall not
have the right to choose his ruler, but is a great
race question on which depends the future as
well as the present salvation of the nation, we
need have no fear as to the ultimate result; sound
sense and right judgment will prevail.</p>

<p>That there exists a race question of some
sort must be apparent to every person who
passes through the South. Where six millions
of people of one color and one race live in contact
with twelve millions of another color and
race, there must, of necessity, be a race issue.
The Negro has not behaved unnaturally: he
has, indeed, in the main behaved well; but the
race issue exists and grows. The feeling has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
yet reached the point of personal hostility—at
least on the part of the Whites; but as the
older generation which knew the tie between
master and servant passes away, the race feeling
is growing intenser. The Negro becomes
more assertive, the White more firm.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There are a multitude of men and women
at the North who do not know that slavery ever
really existed at the North. They may accept
it historically in a dim, theoretical sort of way,
as we accept the fact that men and women were
once hanged for forgery or for stealing a shilling;
but they do not take it in as a vital fact.</p>

<p>It may possibly aid the solution of our problem
if it be shown that New England had quite
as much to do with the establishment of African
slavery on this continent as had the South,
though it survived longest in the latter section;
that slavery at the North was, while it continued,
as rigorous a system as ever it was at
the South; that abolition was at the North in
the main deemed as illegal, and its advocates
encountered as much obloquy there as at the
South; that the emancipation of the slaves was
effected not by the Northern people at large,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
but by a limited band of enthusiasts and in the
wise providence of God; that the emancipation
proclamation was not based on the lofty moral
principle of universal freedom, to which it has
been the custom to accredit it, but was a war-measure,
resorted to only on “necessity of
war,” and as a means of restoring the Union.
Further, that the investment of the Negro with
the elective franchise was not the result of a
high moral sentiment founded on the rights of
man, but was effected in a spirit of heat if not
of revenge, and under a misapprehension of
the true bearing of such an act; that the Negro
has not used the power vested in him for the
advantage of himself or of anyone else, but in
a reckless, unreasonable, and dangerous way;
that while there have been cases of injustice to
him, in the main the restraints thrown around
him at the South have been merely such as were
rendered necessary to preserve the South from
absolute and irretrievable ruin; that the same
instincts under which the South has acted prevail
at the North; that the Negro has been and
is being educated by the South to an extent far
beyond his right to claim, or the ability of the
white race to contribute to it; that he is as yet
incapable, as a race, of self-government. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
finally, that unless the white race continues to
assert itself and retains control, a large section of
the nation will become hopelessly Africanized,
and American civilization relapse and possibly
perish.</p>

<p>Slavery was until within, historically speaking,
a very recent period, as much a Northern
institution as it was a Southern one; it existed
in full vigor in all of the original thirteen colonies,
and while it existed it was quite as rigorous
a system at the North as at the South.
Every law which formed its code at the South
had its counterpart in the North, and with less
reason; for while there were at the South not
less than 600,000 slaves—Virginia having, by
the census of 1790, 293,427—there were at
the North, by the census of 1790, less than
42,000.</p>

<p>Regulations not wholly compatible with absolute
freedom of will are necessary concomitants
of any system of slavery, especially where
the slaves are in large numbers; and it should
move the hearts of our brethren at the North
to greater patience with us that they, too, are
not “without sin.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts has the honor of being the first
community in America to legalize the slave-trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
and slavery by legislative act; the first to
send out a slave-ship, and the first to secure a
fugitive-slave law.</p>

<p>Slavery having been planted on this continent
(not by the South, as has been reiterated until
it is the generally received doctrine, but by a
Dutch ship, which in 1619 landed a cargo of
“twenty negers” in a famished condition at
Jamestown), it shortly took general root, and
after a time began to flourish. Indeed, it flourished
here and elsewhere, so that in 1636, only
seventeen years later, a ship, <em>The Desire</em>, was
built and fitted out at Marblehead as a slaver,
and thus became the first American slave-ship,
but by no means the last. In the early period
of the institution it was conceived that as it was
justified on the ground that the slaves were
heathen, conversion to Christianity might operate
to emancipate them. In Virginia, the leading
Southern colony, it was adjudicated that this
did not so operate; but long prior to that, and
while it was the accepted theory, Negroes are
shown, by the church records, to have been baptized.
In Massachusetts, at that time, baptism
was expressly prohibited.</p>

<p>The fugitive-slave law, which proved ultimately
and naturally so powerful an excitant in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the history of slavery, and which is generally
believed to have been the product of only Southern
cupidity and brutality, had its prototype in
the Articles of the Confederation of the United
Colonies of New England (19th May, 1643),
in which Massachusetts was the ruling colony.</p>

<p>Many of the good people of Massachusetts,
in their zeal and their misapprehension of the
facts, have been accustomed to regard their
own skirts as free from all taint whatsoever of
the accursed doctrine of property in human beings,
and have been wont to boast that slavery
never existed by virtue of law in that grand old
Commonwealth, and that certainly no human
creature was ever born a slave on her sacred
soil. For refutation one need go no further
than the work of Mr. George H. Moore, entitled
“History of Slavery in Massachusetts.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Mr. Moore was librarian of the Historical Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
of New York, and corresponding member
of the Historical Society of Massachusetts. He
says, page 19, citing Commonwealth <em>vs.</em> Aves,
18 Pick., Shaw, C. J.: “It has been persistently
asserted and repeated by all sorts of authorities,
historical and legal, up to that of the chief justice
of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth,
that ‘slavery to a certain extent seems
to have crept in; not probably by force of any
law, for none such is found or known to exist.’”
“In Mr. Sumner’s famous speech in the Senate,
June 28, 1854, he boldly asserted that ‘in all
her annals no person was ever born a slave on
the soil of Massachusetts’; and, says he, ‘if in
point of fact the issue of slaves was sometimes
held in bondage, it was never by sanction of any
statute law of colony or commonwealth.’”</p>

<p>“And,” says Mr. Moore further, “recent
writers of history in Massachusetts have assumed
a similar lofty and positive tone on this
subject. Mr. Palfrey says: ‘In fact, no person
was ever born into legal slavery in Massachusetts.’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Mr. Justice Gray, in an elaborate
historical note to the case of Oliver <em>vs.</em> Sale,
Quincy’s R. 29, says: ‘Previously to the adoption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
of the State Constitution in 1780, Negro
slavery existed to some extent and Negroes held
in slavery might be sold; but all children of
slaves were by law free.’”</p>

<p>Is it any ground for wonder that with these
apparently authoritative statements ever iterated
and reiterated before them, the people of
Massachusetts should really have believed that
no child had ever been born into slavery on the
sacred soil of Massachusetts, and that slavery
itself only existed to “some extent”?</p>

<p>Mr. Moore, with authorities in hand, shows
that these declarations are unfounded, and
states the uncomfortable but real facts. He
quotes the ninety-first article of “The Body of
Liberties,” which appears in the first edition
under the head of “Liberties of Forreiners &amp;
Strangers,” and in the second edition, that of
1660, under the title of “Bond-Slavery.”</p>

<p>“91. There shall never be any bond-slaverie,
villinage or captivity amongst us unles it be lawfull
captives taken in just warres, and such
strangers as willingly sell themselves or are
<span class="allsmcap">SOLD TO US</span>. And these shall have all the liberties
and Christian usages which the law of God
established in Israel concerning such persons
doeth morally require. This exempts none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
from servitude who shall be judged thereto by
authoritie.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>After showing the evolution of this law, Mr.
Moore, on page 18, says:</p>

<p>“Based on the Mosaic Code, it is an absolute
recognition of slavery as a legitimate status,
and of the right of one man to sell himself, as
well as that of another man to buy him. It
sanctions the slave-trade and the perpetual
bondage of Indians and Negroes, their children
and their children’s children, and entitles Massachusetts
to precedence over any and all other
colonies in similar legislation. It anticipates by
many years anything of the sort to be found in
the statutes of Virginia or Maryland or South
Carolina, and nothing like it is to be found in
the contemporary codes of her sister colonies in
New England.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Chief-Justice Parsons, in the leading Massachusetts
case of Winchendon <em>vs.</em> Hatfield in error,
referring to the dictum of C. J. Dana in a
previous case, that a Negro born in that colony
prior to the Constitution of 1780 was free,
though born of slave parents, admits candidly:
“It is very certain that the general practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and common usage had been opposed to this
opinion.”</p>

<p>These and other authorities cited by Mr.
Moore would seem to place the matter absolutely
beyond all question.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Now as to the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>What are the historical facts as to this? It
is true that slavery had been abolished at the
North; but this was under conditions which,
had they prevailed at the South, would have
been taken advantage of there also; and when
the institution was abolished in the Northern
States, it had become so unprofitable that no
great credit can attach to the act of abolition.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
It is also true that there were throughout the
North a considerable body of men and women
who, from a very long time back, believed sincerely
that human slavery was a crime against
nature, and strove zealously and persistently to
overthrow it. At the South there were also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
many who labored with not less earnestness to
effect the same end; though, owing to different
conditions, the same means could not be employed;
and, standing face to face with the immense
slave population which existed at the
South, they saw the same danger which faces us
to-day, and sought in colonization the means at
once to abolish slavery, to free America, and to
Christianize Africa.</p>

<p>As to actual, immediate emancipation, however,
it was no more the intentional work of the
North as a people than it was of the South.</p>

<p>The credit for it, even so far as creating a
public opinion which rendered it eventually possible,
is due to a band of emancipators, who,
for a long time absolutely insignificant in numbers,
and ever comparatively few when contrasted
with the great body of the people of the
North, devoted their energies, their labors,
their lives, to the accomplishment of this end.
During their labors they encountered no less
obloquy, and experienced scarcely less peril at
the North than at the South, with this difference,
that at the North the outrages perpetrated upon
them were inspired by a mere sentiment, while
at the South the vast number of slaves made
any interference with them intolerable, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
treatment abolitionists received was based on a
recognition of the fact that the doctrines they
promulgated might at any moment plunge the
South into the horrors of insurrection.</p>

<p>It was not at the South, but at the North,
in Connecticut, that Prudence Crandall was, for
teaching colored girls, subjected to a persecution
as barbarous as it was persistent. After being
sued and pursued by every process of law which
a New England community could devise, she
was finally driven forth into exile in Kansas.</p>

<p>She opened her school in Canterbury, Connecticut,
in April, 1833, and was at once subjected
to the bitterest persecution conceivable.
It was all well enough to hold theories about
the equal rights of all mankind; well enough to
abuse the institution of slavery in Virginia, in
South Carolina, in Georgia, or in Louisiana;
but actually to start “a nigger school” in Canterbury,
Connecticut, was monstrous. The
town-meeting promptly voted to “petition for
a law against the bringing of colored people
from other towns and States for any purpose,
and more especially for the purpose of dissemination
of the principles and doctrines opposed
to the benevolent colonization scheme.” “In
May an act prohibiting private schools for non-resident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
colored persons, and providing for the
expulsion of the latter, was procured from the
legislature, amid the greatest rejoicings in Canterbury,
even to the ringing of church-bells.”
The most vindictive and inhuman measures
were adopted against the offender; the shops
and meeting-houses were closed against her
and her pupils.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It was not at the South, but at Canaan, New
Hampshire, that on August 10, 1835, the building
of the Noyes Academy, open to pupils of
both colors, in pursuance of a formal town-meeting
vote that it be “removed,” was dragged
by one hundred yoke of oxen from the land belonging
to the corporation, and left on the common,
three hundred yeomen of the county participating.
The teacher and colored pupils
were given a month in which to quit the town.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Throughout New England, less than thirty
years before the promulgation of the emancipation
proclamation abolitionists encountered not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
only opprobrium but violence. When George
Thompson, the English abolitionist, went
throughout the North in 1835, his windows
were broken in Augusta, Maine, where a State
anti-slavery convention was in progress, and a
committee of citizens requested him to leave
town immediately under pain of being mobbed
if he reëntered the convention. At Concord,
New Hampshire, he was interrupted with missiles
while addressing a ladies’ meeting. At
Lowell, Massachusetts, on his second visit, in
the town hall a brick-bat thrown from without
through the window narrowly escaped his head,
and in spite of the manliness of the selectmen
a meeting the next evening was abandoned in
the certainty of fresh and deadly assaults.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is stated in a letter from Mr. William
Lloyd Garrison that Thompson had a narrow
escape from the mob at Concord, and Whittier
was pelted with mud and stones.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> At a convention
in Lynn, George Thompson was stoned.
The next evening he was mobbed by three hundred
men.</p>

<p>All this in New England. Finally, the English
missionary was driven out of the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
being in danger, as Garrison wrote, “of
assassination even in the streets of Boston.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Indeed, mobs were as frequent at
that period in New England as they could
have been in Virginia or South Carolina had
the abolitionists attempted to preach their
doctrines here. William Lloyd Garrison himself
was assailed and denounced, and even in
the city of Boston was subjected to the bitterest
and most persistent persecution. He was
notified to close up the office of his paper, <cite>The
Liberator</cite>, under penalty of tar and feathers.
A placard was circulated, stating that a purse
of one hundred dollars had been raised to reward
the first man who should lay hands on the
“infamous foreign scoundrel Thompson,” so
that he might be brought to the tar-kettle before
dark.</p>

<p>Finally, Garrison himself was mobbed in
Boston, torn out of the house in which was the
office of the Anti-Slavery Society, where he was
attending a meeting of women, dragged through
the streets of Boston with a rope around him,
and but for the cleverness of two sensible men
who got him into the City Hall he would have
been killed. Even there he was in such peril<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
that he was put in the jail to keep him from
the mob, which came near getting possession of
him a second time.</p>

<p>This mob was not, as may be supposed, a mob
of the creatures who usually constitute such an
assemblage, but is said to have been composed of
respectable and well-dressed persons. Garrison,
attacking the mayor afterward, in the press, for
not taking his part more firmly, declared that
if it had been a mob of workingmen assaulting
a meeting of merchants, no doubt he would
have acted with energy, “but broadcloth and
money alter the case.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Indeed, he says, the
mayor acknowledged that “the city government
did not very much disapprove of the mob
to put down such agitators as Garrison and
those like him.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is notable that the entire press of Boston,
with hardly more than one or two exceptions,
approved the action of the mob and censured
Garrison.</p>

<p>This is what Garrison himself said of it:</p>

<p>“1. The outrage was perpetrated in Boston,
the cradle of liberty, the city of Hancock and
Adams, the headquarters of refinement, literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
intelligence, and religion. No comments
can add to the infamy of this fact.</p>

<p>“2. It was perpetrated in the open daylight
of heaven, and was therefore most unblushing
and daring in its features.”</p>

<p>“3. It was dastardly beyond precedent, as it
was an assault of thousands upon a small body
of helpless females. Charleston and New Orleans
have never acted so brutally.</p>

<p>“4. It was planned and executed, not by the
rabble or the workingmen, but by ‘gentlemen
of property and standing, from all parts of the
city’—and now (October 25th) that time has
been afforded for reflection, it is still either
openly justified or coldly disapproved by the
‘higher classes,’ and exultation among them is
general throughout the city....”</p>

<p>“5. It is evidently winked at by the city
authorities. No efforts have been made to arrest
the leading rioters....”</p>

<p>All of this was within three years of the
time when a bill to abolish slavery in Virginia
had failed in her General Assembly by only one
vote and that vote the casting vote of the
speaker.</p>

<p>There is surely no necessity to pile up more
authority on this point. If there were it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
be done; for not only in New England, but elsewhere
in the North, instances can be cited in
which violence, and once even murder, occurred.
Elijah P. Lovejoy, after having his printing-office
sacked three times, fell a martyr to the ferocity
of a mob in Illinois for having, under an
instinct of humanity, aided a fugitive slave to
escape. On one thing, however, the North may
with justice pride itself: that in the end, there
was awakened in it a general sentiment for
emancipation. For this it was indebted to a
work of genius produced by a woman; a romance
which touched the heart of Christendom.
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin” overruled the Supreme
Court of the United States, and abrogated the
Constitution. By arousing the general sentiment
of the world against slavery, it contributed
more than any other one thing to its abolition
in that generation.</p>

<p>But not even then did the North set out to
abolish slavery. President Lincoln is universally
accredited as the emancipator of the African.
It is his hand which is represented in
bronze and marble as striking the shackles from
the slave. He was the chosen and great standard-bearer
of the most advanced element of the
North, the great representative of their ideas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
the idolized chief magistrate, and the trusted
commander of their armies.</p>

<p>His words on this subject must be authoritative.</p>

<p>On the 22d of December, 1860, after South
Carolina had seceded, he says: “Do the Southern
people really entertain fears that a Republican
administration would directly or indirectly
interfere with the slaves or with them about
their slaves? ... The South would be in no
more danger in this respect than it was in the
days of Washington.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1861, in his official
utterance, his inaugural address, he says: “I
have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere
with the institution of slavery in the States
where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful
right to do so, and I have no inclination to do
so.”</p>

<p>If there can possibly be a more authoritative
declaration than this, we have it in a resolution
passed by Congress of the United States, and
signed by Lincoln as President in July, 1861,
after the battle of Manassas:</p>

<p>“Resolved ... that this war is not
waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression,
nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering
with the rights or established institutions of
those States, but to defend and maintain the
supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve
the Union with all the dignity, equality, and
rights of the several States unimpaired,” etc.</p>

<p>Slave-holding even in Federal territory was
not forbidden until June 19, 1862, which was
just a month before the bill was passed providing
that all “slaves of persistent rebels found
in any place occupied or commanded by the
forces of the Union should not be returned to
their masters [as they had hitherto been under
the law], and providing that they might be enlisted
to fight for the Union.”</p>

<p>A Constitutional Amendment (the Thirteenth),
abolishing and prohibiting evermore
the enslavement of human beings, failed to pass
in the House of Representatives in the session
of 1864, and would have failed altogether had
not a member from Ohio changed his vote in
order to move a reconsideration and keep it
alive till the following session, when Mr. Lincoln
having been reëlected, and having recommended
its passage, and the war being evidently
near its end, it was passed by a vote of 119 yeas
to 57 nays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, before Mr. Lincoln issued his emancipation
proclamation he gave one hundred
days’ warning to the revolutionary States to lay
down their arms, and in the proclamation he
places the entire matter forever at rest by declaring
in terms, in that unmistakable English
of which he was a master, that the measure was
adopted “upon military necessity.”</p>

<p>No one can read this record and not admit
that slavery was abolished in the providence of
God, against the intention of the North and
of the South alike, because its purpose had been
accomplished, and the time was ripe for its
ending.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The next step is the discussion of the attitude
in which we, the white people of the South,
stand to the Negro. This attitude is too striking,
if not too anomalous, not to have attracted
wide attention. A race with an historic and
glorious past, in a high stage of civilization,
stands confronted by a race of their former
slaves, invested with every civil and political
right which they themselves possess, and supported
by an outside public sentiment, which if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
not inimical to the dominant race, is at least unsympathetic.
The two races cannot be termed
with exactness hostile—in many respects, not
even unfriendly; but they are suspicious of each
other; their interests are in some essential particulars
conflicting, and in others may easily be
made so; the former slave race has been for
over thirty years politically useful to the outsiders
by whose sentiment they are sustained,
and the former dominant race is unalterably assertive
of the imperative necessity that it shall
govern the inferior race and not be governed
by it.</p>

<p>Now what is the question? Is it merely the
question, “whether the Negro shall not have
the right to choose his own rulers”; or is it a
great race issue between the Negro and the
White?</p>

<p>If it is a question of mere perverse imposition
by the white on the black, by the stronger
on the weaker, a refusal to recognize his just
rights, then the advocates of that side are right.
If, however, it be the other, then the stronger
race should be sustained, or else the people of
the North are guilty of the fatuity which destroys
nations.</p>

<p>The chief complication of the matter has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
arisen from the possession of the elective franchise
by the newly emancipated Negro, and the
peculiar circumstances which surround this possession.
The very method of the bestowal of
this franchise was pregnant with baleful results.
It was given him not as a righteous and reasonable
act; not because he was considered capable
of exercising the highest function of citizenship:
the making of laws, and the execution of laws;
not with the philosophic deliberation which
should characterize an act by which four millions
of new citizens of a distinct and inferior
race are suddenly added to the nation; but in
heat, in a spirit of revenge, and chiefly because
the cabal which then controlled the Republic
thought that with the Negro as an ally it could
dominate the South and perpetuate its own
power. The South, just emerging from the
furious struggle of war, physically prostrate,
but with its dauntless spirit unbroken, confiding
in its own integrity of purpose, and vainly believing
that as the Constitution was the ægis
under which the North had claimed to fight,
the constitutional rights for which it had itself
contended would be observed and respected,
accepted the emancipation of the Negro, but
not unnaturally found itself unwilling, indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
unable, to accept all that this emancipation
might import. The North, partly in distrust of
the sincerity of even the measure of acceptance
which the South avowed; partly in the belief in
the minds of a considerable portion of its people
that the Negro might thus be elevated, and
that he would, at least, be enabled to protect
himself; but mainly to govern the intrepid and
difficult South, at the instance of the partisan
leaders who then directed the destinies of the
Republic, struck down constitutional government
throughout the South, and restored it only when
it had placed it in the Negro’s hands.</p>

<p>No such act of fatuity ever emanated from a
nation. Justification it can have none; its best
excuse must be that it was accomplished under
a certain enthusiasm just after a bitter war, and
before passion had cooled sufficiently for reason
to reassert her sway. It was a people’s insanity.
The “Reconstruction of the South” was,
on the part of the people of the North at large,
simply that which in national life is worse than
a crime, a blunder; on the part of the leaders
who planned it and carried it through, it was
a cool, deliberate, calculated act, violative of
the terms on which the South had surrendered
and disbanded her broken armies, and perpetrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
for the purpose of securing—not peace,
not safety, not righteous acknowledgment of
lawfully constituted authority, but personal
power to the leaders of the party which at that
time was dominant, power with all that it implied
of gain and revenge. For this they took
eight millions of the Caucasian race, a people
which in their devotion and their self-sacrifice,
in their transcendent vigor of intellect, their intrepid
valor in the field, and their fortitude in
defeat, had just elevated their race in the eyes
of mankind, and placed them under the domination
of their former slaves. There is nothing
like it in modern history.</p>

<p>Within two months after Lee’s surrender at
Appomattox there was not a Confederate
within the limits of the Southern States who
had not accepted honestly the status of affairs.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1865, General
Grant, who had been sent through the South
to inspect and make a report on its condition,
in his report to the President said:</p>

<p>“I am satisfied the mass of thinking men in
the South accept the present situation of affairs
in good faith. The questions which have hitherto
divided the sentiment of the people of the
two sections—slavery and State-rights, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
right of the State to secede from the Union—they
regard as having been settled forever by
the highest tribunal, that of arms, that man can
resort to.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the assembling of Congress in
December, 1865, the President was able to
state that the people of North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Tennessee had reorganized
their State governments. The conventions of
the seceding States had all repealed or declared
null and void the ordinances of secession. The
laws were in full operation, and the States were
in reality back in the Union, with duly elected
representatives, generally men who had been
Union men, waiting to be admitted to Congress
when it should assemble.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Had Lincoln but been here, how different
might have been the story! His wisdom, his
sound sense, his catholic spirit, his pride in the
restored Union which he had preserved, his patriotism,
would have governed. For two years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
the influence of his views remained too potent
to be overcome. Johnson, who had not much
love for the South, had caught enough of his
liberal and patriotic spirit to attempt the continuance
of his pacific, constitutional, and sagacious
policy. But he lacked his wisdom, and
by the end of two years the dominant will of
Thad. Stevens and his lieutenants had sufficiently
warped public opinion to bend it to
their pleasure and subvert it to their purpose.
Thad. Stevens gave the keynote. On the 14th
of December, 1865, he said: “According to
my judgment they (the insurrectionary States)
ought never to be recognized as capable of acting
in the Union, or of being counted as valid
States, until the Constitution shall have been so
amended as to make it what its makers intended,
and so as to <em>secure perpetual ascendancy to the
party of the Union</em>.”</p>

<p>Charles Sumner was not behind him. He
declared in January, 1867, that unless universal
suffrage were conferred on all Negroes in the
disorganized States, “you will not secure the
new allies who are essential to the national
cause.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of the scheme of Stevens, in
March, 1867, acts were passed by Congress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
virtually wiping out the States of Virginia,
North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, and
Texas, and dividing the territory into military
districts, under military rulers, who were to
have absolute power over life, property, and
liberty, subject only to the proviso that death
sentences should be approved by the President.</p>

<p>When they were again created States, and
brought back into the Union, the Whites had
been disfranchised, and the Negro had been
created a voter, drafted into the Union League,
drilled under his carpet-bag officers, and accepted
as the new ally through whom was to
be secured “the perpetual ascendancy of the
party of the Union.”</p>

<p>Lincoln in his wisdom and patriotism had
never dreamed of such a thing. His only “suggestion”
had been to let in “some of the colored
people, ... as, for instance, the very
intelligent.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The history of that period, of the reconstruction
period of the South, has never been fully
told. It is only beginning to be written.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
When that history shall be told it will constitute
the darkest stain on the record of the American
people. The sole excuse which can be pleaded
at the bar of posterity, is that the system was
inaugurated in a time of excitement which was
not short of frenzy.</p>

<p>Ever since the Negro was given the ballot he
has, true to his teaching, steadily remained the
ally of the party which gave it to him, following
its lead with more than the obedience of the
slave, and on all issues, in all times, opposing
the respectable white element with whom he
dwelt with a steadfast habitude which is only
explicable on the ground of steadfast purpose.
The phenomenon has been too marked to escape
observation. The North has drawn from
it the not unnatural inference that the Negro
is oppressed by the White, and thus at once asserts
his independence and attempts to obtain
his rights. The South, knowing that he is not
oppressed, draws therefrom the juster inference
that he naturally, wilfully, and inevitably allies
himself against the White simply upon a race
line and stands, irrespective of reason, in persistent
opposition to all measures which the
White advocates.</p>

<p>The North sees in the Negro’s attitude only
the proper and laudable aspiration of a citizen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and a man; the South detects therein a desire to
dominate, a menace to all that the Anglo-American
race has effected on this continent,
and to the hopes in which that race established
this nation.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>To ascertain which is the correct view it
might be well at this point to examine the history
of the Negro and his capacity as a citizen.</p>

<p>In discussing this matter we are fortunately
not relegated to the shadowy and uncertain
domain of mere theory; the argument may be
based on the firm and assured foundation of
actual experience.</p>

<p>In the first place, whatever a sentimental
philanthropy may say; whatever a modern and
misguided humanitarianism may declare, there
underlies the whole matter the indubitable, potent,
and mysterious principle of race quality.
Ethnologically, historically, congenitally, the
white race and the Negro differ widely.</p>

<p>Slavery will not alone account for it all. In
the recorded experience of mankind slavery—mere
slavery—has not repressed intelligence;
the bonds of the person, however tightly drawn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
have not served to shackle the mind. Slavery
existed among the Greeks, the Romans, the
Phœnicians, among our own ancestors of the
Teuton race: slavery as absolute, as inexorable
as ever was African slavery. Indeed, under
some of those systems there was absolute chattel
slavery, which never existed with us, for the
Greek and the Roman possessed over their
slaves the absolute power of life and death;
they might slay them as an exhibition for their
guests, or might cast them into their fish-ponds
as food for their lampreys.</p>

<p>Yet under these systems, differentiated from
African slavery by the two conditions of race
similarity and intellectual potentiality, slaves
attained not unfrequently to high position, and
from them issued some of the most notable literary
productions of those times. Æsop, Terence,
Epictetus the Stoic were slaves. These
and many more have proved that where the intellectual
potentiality exists it will burst through
the encumbering restraints of servitude, and
establish the truth that bondage cannot enthrall
the mind.</p>

<p>What of value to the human race has the
Negro mind as yet produced? In art, in mechanical
development, in literature, in mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
and moral science, in all the range of mental
action, no notable work has up to this time
come from a Negro.</p>

<p>In the earliest records of the human race, the
monuments of Egypt and Syria, he is depicted
as a slave bearing burdens; after tens of centuries
he is still a menial. Four thousand years
have not served to whiten the pigments of the
frame, nor developed the forces of the intellect.
The leopard cannot change his spots to-day, nor
the Ethiopian his skin, any more than they
could in the days of Jeremiah the son of
Hilkiah.</p>

<p>It is not argued that because a Negro is a
Negro he is incapable of any intellectual development.
On the contrary, observation has led
me to think that under certain conditions of
intellectual environment, of careful training,
and of sympathetic encouragement from the
stronger races he may individually attain a fair,
and in uncommon instances a considerable degree,
of mental development. To deny this is
to deny the highest attribute of the intellectual
essence, and is to shut the door of hope upon
a race of God’s human creatures to whom I give
my sympathy and my good-will. But the incontestable
proof is that such cases of intellectual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
development are exceptional instances, and that
after long, elaborate, and ample trial the Negro
race has failed to discover the qualities which
have inhered in every race of which history
gives the record, which has advanced civilization,
or has shown capacity to be itself greatly
advanced.</p>

<p>Where the Negro has thriven it has invariably
been under the influence and by the assistance
of the stronger race. Where these have
been wanting, whatever other conditions have
existed, he has sensibly and invariably reverted
toward the original type. Liberia, Hayti,
Congo, are all in one line.</p>

<p>His history on his native continent is pregnant
with suggestion. As far as the East is from
the West, Negro-Africa is from the land of
civilization. Generations have come and gone;
centuries have followed centuries; peoples have
succeeded peoples; nations have been grafted
on nations, more and more crowned with the
sunlight of progress and of civilization; but no
faintest beam has ever pierced the impenetrable
gloom of the “Dark Continent,” and the last
African explorer’s latest book is “Darkest
Africa.”</p>

<p>This has not been because opportunity has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
been wanting. Civilization first lit her golden
torch upon her borders. The swelling waters
of the Nile spread through a lettered and partly
enlightened people when the Tiber crept
through swamps and wilderness; when the
Acropolis was a wild, and the seven hills of the
Eternal City a range for wolves, Thebes and
Memphis and Heliopolis contained a civilization
which in some of its manifestations has
never been equalled since. Rome stretched
across the Mediterranean, and sent her civilizing
power along the northern shore of the continent;
and later, the Moors possessed a
civilization there which is yet a marvel even to
our race. In that record which all Christendom
holds as its cherished possession we catch
glimpses of a commerce and even of a civilization
situate somewhere within the boundaries of
Africa, and meeting with that of the greatest
monarch of the time. The curtain suddenly
lifts and we get a view all the more dazzling,
because so mysterious, of a queen of Ethiopia
coming with wonderful gifts to visit Solomon
himself.</p>

<p>Since then civilization has swept triumphant
over a large part of the earth. Only the land
of the Negro has never yielded to her illumining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
and vivifying influence. The Roman has
succeeded the Greek; the Gaul and the Frank
have risen on the Roman; the Teuton, the
Saxon, and the Celt have surpassed the Gaul.
Only in Negro-Africa has barbarism held unbroken
rule, and savagery maintained perpetual
domain.</p>

<p>Stanley, Ward, Glave, and Emin Pasha
found but a few years since the great Congo
country as barbarous, as savage, as cannibal, as
it was five thousand years ago, province preying
on province, and village feeding on village, as
debased and brutish as the beasts of the jungle
about them.</p>

<p>But it is not only in Africa that the Negro
has exhibited the absence of the essential qualities
of a progressive race. It is everywhere.
Since the dawn of history, the Negro has been
in one place or another, in Egypt, in Rome, in
other European countries, brought in contact
with civilization, yet he has failed to receive
the vitalizing current under which other races
have risen in greater or less degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Here in America for over two hundred
years the Negro has been under the immediate
influence of the most potent race the world has
known, and within the sweep of the ripest period
of the world’s history.</p>

<p>It may be charged that as a slave he never
had an opportunity to give his faculties that
exercise which is necessary to their development.
But the answer is complete. He has not been
a slave in all places, at all times. In Africa he
was not a slave, save to himself and his own
instincts; in Rome he was no more a slave than
was the Teuton, the Greek, or the Gaul; in
New England he has not been a slave for over
a hundred years, and may be assumed to have
had there as much encouragement, and to have
received as sustaining an influence as will ever
be accorded him by the White. What has been
the result even in New England?</p>

<p>Dr. Henry M. Field a few years since wrote a
book of travels in the South with his reflections
thereon. Dr. Field comes of a distinguished
Northern family, of which the whole country
is proud. He is a close observer, a fair recorder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
and the friend of the whole human
race. He will not be accused of prejudice.
Speaking of the present intellectual condition
of the Negro in Massachusetts, he says:</p>

<p>“Yet here we are doomed to great disappointment.
The black man has had every right
that belongs to his white neighbor; not only the
natural rights which, according to the Declaration
of Independence, belong to every human
being—the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness—but the right to vote, and to have
a part in making the laws. He could own his
little home, and there sit under his own vine
and fig-tree with none to molest or make him
afraid. His children could go to the same common
schools, and sit on the same benches, and
learn the same lessons as white children.</p>

<p>“With such advantages, a race that had
natural genius ought to have made great progress
in a hundred years. But where are the
men that it should have produced to be the
leaders of their people? We find not one who
has taken rank as a man of action or a man
of thought; as a thinker or a writer; as artist
or poet; as discoverer or inventor. The whole
race has remained on one dead level of mediocrity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“If any man ever proved himself a friend
of the African race it was Theodore Parker,
who endured all sorts of persecution and social
ostracism, who faced mobs and was hissed and
hooted in public meetings, for his bold championship
of the rights of the Negro race. But
rights are one thing, and capacity is another.
And while he was ready to fight for them he
was very despondent as to their capacity for rising
in the scale of civilization. Indeed, he said
in so many words: ‘In respect to the power of
civilization, the African is at the bottom, the
American Indian next.’ In 1857 he wrote to
a friend: ‘There are inferior races which have
always borne the same ignoble relation to the
rest of men and always will. In two generations
what a change there will be in the condition
and character of the Irish in New England.
But in twenty generations the Negroes will
stand just where they are now; that is, if they
have not disappeared.’</p>

<p>“That was more than thirty years ago. But
to-day I look about me here in Massachusetts,
and I see a few colored men; but what are they
doing? They work in the fields, they hoe corn,
they dig potatoes; the women take in washing.
I find colored barbers and white-washers, shoe-blacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
and chimney-sweeps; but I do not know
a single man who has grown to be a merchant
or a banker, a judge or a lawyer, a member of
the legislature or a justice of the peace, or even
a selectman of the town. In all these respects
they remain where they were in the days of our
fathers. The best friends of the colored race,
of whom I am one, must confess that it is disappointing
and discouraging to find that with
all these opportunities they are little removed
from where they were a hundred years ago.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>But suppose that the statements of others,
whose observation has enabled them to pick out
a well-to-do lawyer or dentist or doctor or
restaurateur, be different, it only proves that in
individual instances they may rise to a fair
level; it simply emphasizes the fact that these
are exceptions to the great rule, and does not in
the least affect the argument, which is that the
Negroes <em>as a race</em> have never exhibited much
capacity to advance; that as a race they are inferior
to other races.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Opportunity is afforded us to examine the
Negro’s progress in two countries in which a
civilization was created for him, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
surrounded by every condition helpful to
progress.</p>

<p>The first is Liberia. There he had a model
republic founded by the Caucasian solely for
his benefit, with freedom grafted in its name.
It was founded in as splendid hopes as even this
Republic itself. Christendom gave it its assistance
and its prayers. How has the Negro progressed
there? Let one of his own race tell the
story, one who was thought competent to represent
there the United States. Mr. Charles H.
J. Taylor, late Minister from the United States
to Liberia, has given a picture of life in Liberia,
which cannot be equalled save in some
other country under the same rule. He says,
in a paper published in the <cite>Kansas City Times</cite>,
April 22, 1888:</p>

<p>“Not a factory, mill, or workshop, of any
kind, is to be found there. They (the government)
have no money or currency in circulation
of any kind. They have no boats of any character,
not even a canoe, the two gunboats England
gave them lying rotten on the beach.”...
“Look from morn till night you will
never see a horse, a mule, a donkey, or a broken-in
ox. They have them not. There is not a
buggy, a wagon, a cart, a slide, a wheelbarrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
in the four counties. The natives carry everything
on their heads.”</p>

<p>The whole picture presented is hopeless.</p>

<p>If this were an isolated instance we might
think that climatic influences or the proximity
of a great savage continent had affected the
result. But we have nearer home a yet more
striking illustration, a yet more convincing proof
that the real cause was the Negro’s inability to
govern, his incapacity to rise.</p>

<p>For a hundred years now the Negro has cast
his influence over sundry of the West Indies,
and has had sole possession of one. With this
Republic constructed by our fathers before him
for a model, he has since 1804 been masquerading
at governing Hayti, one of the most fertile
spots that Spain ever ruled.</p>

<p>A more fantastic mummery never disgraced
a people or degraded a land. From the time
of Toussaint L’Ouverture to the present there
has not been a break in the darkness which
settled upon Santo Domingo when it passed
under the control of the Negro.</p>

<p>The bloody Dessalines aping Napoleon, and
with the oath of allegiance to the republic yet
warm on his lips, crowning himself “Emperor”
of half an island; the brutal Gonaives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
Boyer, Soulouque, and their like, following each
other, each as brutal and swinish as the other, or
with degrees limited only by their capacity, present
a picture such as history cannot duplicate.</p>

<p>We have accounts of Hayti by two Englishmen,
one the historian Froude, the other, Sir
Spencer St. John, for years British resident at
Hayti, both of whom assert that they have no
race antipathy. And what a picture do they
present! Santo Domingo, once the Queen of
the Antilles, has in less than a hundred years
of Negro rule sunk well-nigh into a state of
primeval barbarism.</p>

<p>Sir Spencer St. John, in his astounding work,
“The Black Republic,” has given a picture of
Hayti under Negro rule which is enough to give
pause alike to the wildest theorist and the most
vindictive partisan. He takes pains to tell us
that he has lived for thirty-five years among
colored people of various races, and has no prejudice
against them; that the most frequent and
not the least honored guests at his table in
Hayti for twelve years were of the black and
colored races. The picture he has presented is
the blackest ever drawn: revolution succeeding
revolution, and massacre succeeding massacre;
the country once, under white rule, teeming with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
wealth and covered with beautiful villas and
plantations, with “a considerable foreign commerce,
now in a state of decay and ruin, without
trade or resources of any kind; peculation and
jobbery paramount in all public offices”; barbarism
substituted for civilization; Voudou
worship in place of Christianity, and occasions
when human flesh has been actually sold in the
market-place of Port au Prince, the capital of
the country.</p>

<p>Sir Spencer St. John says that a Spanish colleague
once said to him: “If we could return
to Hayti fifty years hence, we should find the
negresses cooking their bananas on the site of
these warehouses.” On which he remarks: “It
is more than probable—unless in the mean time
influenced by some higher civilization—that this
prophecy will come true. The negresses are,
in fact, cooking their bananas amid the ruins
of the best houses of the capital.”</p>

<p>If it shall seem to those who have no actual
knowledge upon the subject that I have overdrawn
the picture, I would refer them to the
papers which I have cited, and the works which
I have quoted, and to the great body of the
Southern people who have had experience of
what Negro domination imports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>What has been stated has been said in no
feeling of personal hostility, or even unfriendliness
to the Negro, for I have no unfriendliness
toward any Negro on earth; on the contrary, I
have a feeling of real friendliness toward many
of that race, and am the well-wisher of the
whole people.</p>

<p>What is contained in this paper is stated under
a sense of duty, with the hope and in the belief
that it may serve to call attention to the real
facts in the case; that it may help to discard
from the discussion all mere sentimentality or
prejudice, and to base the future consideration
of the matter upon the only solid ground—the
ground of naked fact.</p>

<p>The examples cited, if they establish anything,
establish the fact that the Negro race
does not possess, in any development which he
has yet attained, the fundamental elements of
character, the essential qualifications to conduct
a government, even for himself, and that if the
reins of government be intrusted to his unaided
hands, he will fling reason to the winds, and
drive to ruin. Were this, however, only Hayti
or Liberia, we might bear it with such philosophic
patience as our philanthropy calls to our
aid, but we have nearer home a proof not less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
overwhelming of this truth. The Negro has
had control of the government in the Southern
States; for eight years a number of Southern
States were partly, and three of them were
wholly given up to the control of the Negroes,
directed by men of, at least, ability and experience,
and sustained by the invigorating influence
of the entire North. It was “an experiment”
entered on with “enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>The reconstruction acts gave the black the
absolute right of suffrage, and disfranchised
the whites. The Negro was invested with absolute
power, and turned loose. He selected his
rulers. The entire weight of the government—an
immense force—was under the misapprehension,
born of the passion which then reigned,
thrown blindly in the Negroes’ favor; whatever
they asserted was believed; whatever they demanded
was done; the ballot was given them,
and all the forms established by generations of
Caucasian patriots and jurists, and consecrated
by centuries of Caucasian blood, were solemnly
set up and solemnly followed. The Negro at
least then selected his own rulers. The Negro
had thus his opportunity then, if ever. The
North had put him up as a citizen against the
protest of the South, and stood obliged to sustain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
him. What was the result? Such a riot
of folly and extravagance, such a travesty of
justice, such a mummery of government as was
never before witnessed, save in those countries
in which he had himself furnished the illustration.</p>

<p>In Virginia, where the Negroes were in a
numerical minority and where the prowess of
the Whites had been but now displayed before
their eyes in an impressive manner which they
could not forget, we escaped the inconveniences
of carpet-baggism, and the Hunnycuts, Underwoods,
and such vultures kept the carcass for
their own picking, and were soon gorged and
put to flight. But it was not so where the Negroes
were in a large majority. In South Carolina,
in Louisiana, in Mississippi, and in other
Southern States there was a very carnival of
riot and rapine.</p>

<p>Space will not permit the going into detail.
Reference can only be made to one or two facts,
from which the whole dreadful story may be
gathered. Louisiana will be first cited.</p>

<p>Warmouthism and Kelloggism, in Louisiana,
and carpet-baggism generally, with all their environments
of chicanery and venality, and all
their train of poverty and profligacy, cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
done justice to in a paper of this character.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Such a relation of theft, debauchery, and crime
has not been found outside of those countries
in which carpet-baggism has ruled, with the
Negro as its facile and ignorant instrument.</p>

<p>In Louisiana, soon after Warmouth came
into office, he stated in his message of 4th January,
1868, to his legislature: “Our debt is
smaller than that of almost any State in the
Union, with a tax-roll of $251,000,000, and
a bonded debt that can at will be reduced to
$6,000,000. There is no reason that our credit
should not be at par.” This was too good a
field for Warmouth and his associates to lose.
Says Mr. Sage: “The census of 1870 showed
the debt of the State to have increased to $25,021,734,
and that of the parishes and municipalities
to $28,065,707. Within a year the
State debt was increased fourfold, and the local
indebtedness had doubled. Louisiana, according
to the census, stood, in the matter of debt,
at the head of the Union.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>This was but the beginning. The total cost
of four years and five months of Republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
rule amounted to $106,020,337, or $24,040,089
per year. “To this,” says Mr. Sage,
“must be added the privileges and franchises
given away and the State property stolen.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Taxation went up in proportion—in some
places to 7 or 8 per cent.;<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> in others as high
as 16 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This was confiscation.</p>

<p>The public printing of the State had, in previous
years, cost about $37,000 per year. During
the first two years of Warmouth’s <em>régime</em>
the New Orleans <cite>Republican</cite>, in which he was
a principal stockholder, received $1,140,881.77
for public printing.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>When Warmouth ran for governor, he was
so poor that a mite chest was placed beside the
ballot-box to receive contributions to pay his
expenses to Washington. When he had been
in office only a year, it was estimated that he
was worth $225,000, and when he retired he
was said to have had one of the largest fortunes
in Louisiana.</p>

<p>The Louisiana State Lottery, with all the
debauchery of morals and sentiment which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
has occasioned, was chartered by Warmouth
and his gang, and is a legacy which they have
left to the people of that State, an octopus
which they have vainly striven to shake off.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Time fails to tell of the rapine, the vice, the
profligacy in which the government—State and
municipal—was the prize which was tossed
about like a shuttle-cock, from one faction to the
other; of the midnight orders to seize the government,
the carnival of corruption and crime,
until the Whites were forced to band themselves
into a league to prevent absolute anarchy. It
suffices to say that it was in Louisiana under
Negro rule that troops were marched into the
State House, and drove out the assembled representatives
of the State, at the point of the
bayonet, a thing which has happened during
peace only twice before in the history of modern
civilization, once under Cromwell and once
under Napoleon.</p>

<p>“The vampire Warmouthism had reduced
the wealth of New Orleans from $146,718,790
at Warmouth’s advent, to $88,613,930 at Kellogg’s
exit—a net decline of $58,104,860 in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
eight years; while real estate in the country parishes
had shrunk in value from $99,266,839.85
to $47,141,696, or about one-half. During this
period the Republican leaders had squandered
nearly $150,000,000, giving the State little or
nothing to show therefor.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>In Mississippi the corruption was almost as
great, and the result almost as disastrous. The
State levy for 1871 was four times what it was
in 1869; for 1872 it was four times as great;
for 1873 it was eight and a half times as great;
for 1874 it was fourteen times as great. Six
million four hundred thousand acres of land,
comprising 20 per cent. of all the lands in the
State, had been forfeited for non-payment of
taxes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In South Carolina, if it were possible, the
situation was even worse, and the paper contributed
to the series to which I have already
alluded, by the Hon. John J. Hemphill, to
which I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness,
outlines briefly the condition of affairs, and presents
a picture which ought to be read by every
man in the Union. The General Assembly,
which convened in 1868, in Columbia, consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
of 72 Whites and 85 Negroes. In the house
were 14 Democrats, and in the senate 7; the
remaining 136 were Republicans. One of the
first acts passed was somewhat anomalous.
After defending the rights of the colored man
on railroads, in theatres, etc., it provided that
if a person whose rights under the act were
claimed to be violated, was a Negro, then the
burden of proof should shift and be on the defendant,
and he should be presumed to be guilty
until he established his innocence. This Act
was more or less expressive of the spirit in
which a good many people at the North still
appear to regard all questions arising between
the Southern Whites and the Negroes.</p>

<p>When the legislature met, they proceeded to
furnish the halls at a cost of $50,000, for which
they appropriated $95,000. This hall has since
been entirely refurnished at a cost of $3,061.
They paid out in four years, for furniture, over
$200,000, and when, in 1877, the matter was
investigated, it was found that, even placing
what remained at the original purchase price,
there was left by them in the State House only
$17,715 worth; the rest had disappeared.</p>

<p>“They opened another account, known under
the vague but comprehensive head of ‘Supplies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
sundries, and incidentals.’ This amounted,
in a single session, to $350,000. For six years
they ran an open bar in one of the legislative
committee rooms, open from 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, to 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
at which all the officials and their friends helped
themselves, with cost—save to the unfortunate
and helpless taxpayers.’</p>

<p>They organized railroad frauds, election
frauds, census frauds, general frauds—whatever
they organized was filled with fraud. They
enlisted and equipped an armed force, the governor—one
Scott—refusing to accept any but
colored companies. Ninety-six thousand colored
men were enrolled at a cost, for the simple
enrolment, of over $200,000. One thousand
Winchester rifles were obtained, for which the
State was charged about $38,000; 1,000,000
cartridges cost the State $37,000; 10,000
Springfield muskets were bought, and charged
at a cost, they claim, of $187,050; it was all
charged to the State at $250,000. The troops,
as organized, were employed by Scott and the
notorious Moses as their heelers and henchmen.
The armed force, or constabulary, were armed
and maintained for the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Governor Scott spent $374,000 of the funds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
of the State in his canvass.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Eight porters
were employed in the State House; they issued
certificates to 238; eight laborers and from five
to twenty pages were employed; certificates were
issued to 159 of the former and 124 of the
later. One lot of 150 certificates were issued
at once—all fraudulent. During one session
pay certificates were issued to the amount of
$1,168,255, all of which but about $200,000
was unvarnished robbery.</p>

<p>The public printing was another field for
their robbery. The total cost of the printing
in South Carolina for the eight years of Republican
domination, 1868-76, was $1,326,589.
The total cost for printing for 78 years previous—from
1790 to 1868—was $609,000,
showing an excess for the cost of printing in
eight years, over 78 years previous, of $717,589.
The average cost of the public printing under
the Republican administration per year, was
$165,823; average cost per annum under Hampton’s
administration, $6,178. The amount appropriated
for one year, 1872-73, by the Republicans,
for printing, was $450,000; amount
appropriated in 25 years ending in 1866, $278,251.
Excess of one year’s appropriation over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
25 years, $171,749. The cost of printing in
South Carolina exceeded in one year by $122,932.13
the cost of like work in Massachusetts,
New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Maryland
together.</p>

<p>In 1860 the taxable values in the State
amounted to $490,000,000, and the tax to a
little less than $400,000. In 1871 the taxable
value had been reduced to $184,000,000, and
the tax increased to $2,000,000. In 19 counties
taken together, 93,293 acres of land were
sold in one year for unpaid taxes. After four
years of Republican rule, the debt of the State
had increased from $5,407,306 to $18,515,033.
There had been no public works of any
importance, and the “entire thirteen millions of
dollars represented nothing but unnecessary and
profligate expenditures and stealings.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The governor’s pardon was a matter of mere
bargain and sale. During Moses’s term of
two years, he issued 457 pardons—pardoning
during the last month of his tenure of office
46 of the 168 convicts whom he had hitherto
left in jail.</p>

<p>In May, 1875, Governor Chamberlain declared,
in an interview with a correspondent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
the <cite>Cincinnati Commercial</cite>, that when at the
end of Moses’s administration he entered on
his duties as governor, 200 trial justices were
holding offices by executive appointment who
could neither read nor write.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>These statements are but fragments taken
from the papers by Mr. Hemphill, Governor
Hampton, and others, who cite the public records,
and are simply bare statistics. No account
has been taken of the imposition practised
throughout the South during the period of
Negro domination; of the vast, incredible, and
wanton degradation of the Southern people by
the malefactors, who, with hoards of ignorant
Negroes just freed from the bonds of slavery as
their instruments, trod down the once stately
South at their will. No wonder that Governor
Chamberlain, Republican and carpet-bagger as
he was, should have declared, as he did in writing
to the New England Society: “The civilization
of the Puritan and Cavalier, of the
Roundhead and Huguenot, is in peril.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>A survey of the field and a careful consideration
of the facts have convinced me that I am
within the bounds of truth, when I say that
the Southern States, with the exception, perhaps,
of one or two of the border States, were better
off in 1868, when reconstruction went into
force, than they were in 1876, when the carpet-bag
governments were finally overthrown; and
that the eight years of Negro domination in
the South cost the South directly and indirectly
more than the entire cost of the war, inclusive
of the loss of values in slave property. I
think if Mr. Cable, and those who accept his
theorem, will study the history of the Southern
States, even as written only in the statistics, taking
no account, if they please, of the suffering
and the humiliation inflicted on the white race
of the South during the period in which the
South was under the domination of the rulers
selected by the Negroes, they will find that there
is not so much difference between the proposition
which he formulates and that which the
South states, when it declares that the pending
question is one of race domination, on which
depends the future salvation of the American
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Twenty-seven years have rolled by since the
Negro was given his freedom; nearly twenty-five
years have passed since he was given a part
in the government, and was taken up to be educated.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
The laws were so adapted that there is
not now a Negro under forty years old who
has not had the opportunity to receive a public
school education. Through private philanthropy
these public schools (many of which are
of a high grade) have been supplemented by
institutions established on private foundations.
That the Negroes have had a not ungeneral
ambition to attend school is apparent from the
school attendance of the race, as shown by the
statistics, the Negro enrolment in the schools
for the session of 1878-88 being 1,140,405, or
a little over one-half of their entire school population.</p>

<p>Besides this, every profession, every trade,
and every department of life have been open to
him as to the White; he has had his own race as
his constituency; he has possessed the backing of
the North, and the good-will of the South. But
what has he done? What has he attained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>The South has viewed his political course
with suspicion, and in this field of activity has
opposed him with all her resources; but she
has not been mean or niggardly toward him.
On the contrary, in every place, at all times, even
while she was resisting and assailing him for
his political action, she has displayed toward
him in the expenditures for his education a
liberality which, in relation to her ability,
amounted to lavishness.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. A. D. Mayo, eminent alike
for his learning and philanthropy, and a
Northern educator of note, declared not long
ago that “No other people in human history
has made an effort so remarkable as the people
of the South in reëstablishing their schools and
colleges. Overwhelmed by war and bad government,
they have done wonders, and with the
interest and zeal now felt in public schools in
the South, the hope for the future is brighter
than ever.” “Last year,” he says, speaking in
1888, “these sixteen States paid nearly $1,000,000
each for educational purposes, a sum
greater according to their means than ten times
the amount now paid by most of the New England
States.”</p>

<p>Virginia has expended on her public schools,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
including the session of 1890-91, according to
the figures of Colonel Ruffin, the Second Auditor
of Virginia, taken from official sources,
$23,380,309.97. Her Negro schools cost her
for the year 1889-90, by the same estimate,
$420,000, of which the Negroes paid about
$60,000.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Governor Gordon, of Georgia, in a recent
address, said of that State: “When her people
secured possession of the State government,
they found about six thousand colored pupils
in the public schools, with the school exchequer
bankrupt. To-day, instead of six thousand, we
have over one hundred and sixty thousand colored
pupils in the public schools, with the exchequer
expanding and the schools multiplying
year by year.” He says further, “The Negroes
pay one-thirtieth of the expense, and the other
twenty-nine-thirtieths are paid by the whites.”</p>

<p>The other Southern States have not been behind
Virginia and Georgia in this matter.</p>

<p>Now what has the Negro accomplished in
this quarter of a century? The picture drawn
by Dr. Field of his accomplishment in Massachusetts
would do for the South.</p>

<p>“They work in the fields, they hoe corn, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
dig potatoes; the women take in washing.”
They are barbers and white-washers, shoe-blacks
and chimney-sweeps. Here and there we find
a lawyer or two, unhappily with their practice
in inverse ratio to their principle. Or now
and then there is a doctor. But almost invariably
these are men with a considerable infusion
of white blood in their veins. And even they
have, in no single instance, attained a position
which in a white would be deemed above mediocrity.
Fifteen years ago there were in Richmond
a number of Negro tobacco and other
manufacturers in a small way. Now there are
hardly any except undertakers.</p>

<p>They do not appear to possess the faculties
which are essential to conduct any business in
which reason has to be applied beyond the immediate
act in hand.</p>

<p>They appear to lack the faculty of organization
on which rests all successful business enterprise.</p>

<p>They have been losing ground as mechanics.
Before the war, on every plantation there were
first-class carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights,
etc. Half the houses in Virginia were built by
Negro carpenters. Now where are they? In
Richmond there may be a few blacksmiths and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
a dozen or two carpenters; but where are the
others?</p>

<p>A great strike occurred last year in one of
the large iron-works of the city of Richmond.
The president of the company stated afterward
that, although the places at the machines were
filled later on by volunteers, and although there
were many Negroes who did not strike employed
in the works, it never occurred to either
the management or to the Negroes that they
could work at the machines, and not one had
ever suggested it.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, Have they improved?
Many persons declare that they have
not. My observation has led to a somewhat
different conclusion. Where they have been
brought into contact with the stronger race
under conditions in which they derived aid, as
in cities, they have in certain directions improved;
where they have lacked this stimulating
influence, as in sections of the country where
the association has steadily diminished, they
have failed to advance. In the cities, where
they are in touch with the whites, they are, I
think, becoming more dignified, more self-respecting,
more reasonable; in the country,
where they are left to themselves, I fail to see
this improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>This improvement, however, such as it is,
does not do away with the race issue. So far
from it, it rather intensifies the feeling, certainly
on the part of the Negro, and makes the relation
more strained. Yet it is our only hope.
The white race, it is reasonably certain, is not
going to be ruled by the Negro either North or
South. That day is far off, and neither Lodge
bills nor any other bills can bring it about until
they can reverse natural law, enact that ignorance
shall be above intelligence, and exalt feebleness
over strength. The history of that race is a
guarantee that this cannot be. It has been a conquering
race from its first appearance, like the
Scythians of old,</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">“Firm to resolve and steadfast to endure.”</p>

<p>The section of it which inhabits the United
States is not yet degenerate. That part of it
at the South assuredly is not. It is not necessary
to recall its history. It is one of the finest
pages in the history of the human race. Let
one who has not been generally regarded as
unduly biassed in favor of the South speak for
it. Senator Hoar, speaking of the people of
the South on the floor of the Senate, in the
speech already referred to, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>They have some qualities which I cannot even presume
to claim in an equal degree for the people among whom I,
myself, dwell. They have an aptness for command which
makes the Southern gentleman, wherever he goes, not a
peer only, but a prince. They have a love for home; they
have, the best of them, and the most of them, inherited
from the great race from which they come, the sense of
duty and the instinct of honor as no other people on the
face of the earth. They are lovers of home. They have
not the mean traits which grow up somewhere in places
where money-making is the chief end of life. They have,
above all, and giving value to all, that supreme and superb
constancy which, without regard to personal ambition and
without yielding to the temptation of wealth, without getting
tired and without getting diverted, can pursue a great
public object, in and out, year after year and generation
after generation.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the race which the Negro confronts.
It is a race which, whatever perils have impended,
has always faced them with a steadfast
mind.</p>

<p>Professor James Bryce in a recent paper on
the Negro question arrives at the only reasonable
conclusion: that the Negro be let alone and
the solution of the problem be left to the course
of events. Friendship for the Negro demands
this. It has become the fashion of late for certain
Negro leaders to talk in conventions held
outside of the South of fighting for their rights.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
For their own sake and that of their race, let
them take it out in talking. A single outbreak
would settle the question.</p>

<p>To us of the South it appears that a proper
race pride is one of the strongest securities of
our nation. No people can become great without
it. Without it no people can remain great.
We purpose to stand upon it.</p>

<p>The question now remains, What is to become
of the Negro? It is not likely that he will
remain in his present status, if, indeed, it is
possible for him to do so. Many schemes have
been suggested, none of them alone answerable
to the end proposed. The deportation plan
does not seem practicable at present. It is easy
to suggest theories, but much more difficult to
substantiate them. I hazard one based upon
much reflection on the subject. It is, that the
Negro race in America will eventually disappear,
not in a generation or a century—it may
take several centuries. The means will be
natural. Certain portions of the Southern
States will for a while, perhaps, be almost given
up to him; but in time he will be crowded out
even there. Africa may take a part; Mexico
and South America a part; the rest will, as the
country fills up, as life grows harder and competition
fiercer, become diffused and disappear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
a portion, perhaps, not large, by absorption into
the stronger race, the residue by perishing under
conditions of life unsuited to the race. The
ratio of the death-rate of the race is already
much larger than that of the white. Consumption
and zymotic diseases are already making
their inroads.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Meantime he is here, and something must be
done to ameliorate conditions.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us have all the light
that can be thrown on the subject. Form an
organization to consider and deal with the subject,
not in the spirit of narrowness or temper,
but in a spirit of philosophic deliberation, such
as becomes a great people discussing a great
question which concerns not only their present
but their future position among the nations.
We shall then get at the right of the matter.</p>

<p>Let us do our utmost to eliminate from the
question the complication of its political features.
Get politics out of it, and the problem
will be more than half solved. Senator Hampton
stated not long ago in a paper contributed
by him to the <cite>North American Review</cite> that,
to get the Negro out of politics, he would
gladly give up the representation based on his
vote. Could anything throw a stronger light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
on the apprehension with which the Negro in
politics is regarded at the South?</p>

<p>There never was any question more befogged
with demagogism than that of manhood suffrage.
Let us apply ourselves to the securing
some more reasonable and better basis for the
suffrage. Let us establish such a proper qualification
as a condition precedent to the possession
of the elective franchise as shall leave
the ballot only to those who have intelligence
enough to use it as an instrument to secure good
government rather than to destroy it. In taking
this step we have to plant ourselves on a broader
principle than that of a race qualification. It is
not merely the Negro, it is ignorance and venality
which we should disfranchise. If we can disfranchise
these we need not fear the voter,
whatever the color. At present it is not the
Negro who is disfranchised, but the white. We
dare not divide.</p>

<p>Having limited him in a franchise which he
has not in a generation learned to use, continue
to teach him. It is from the educated Negro;
that is, the Negro who is more enlightened than
the general body of his race, that order must
come. The ignorance, venality, and superstition
of the average Negro are dangerous to us.
Education will divide them and will uplift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
them. They may learn in time that if they wish
to rise they must look to the essential qualities
of good citizenship. In this way alone can the
race or any part of the race look for ultimate
salvation.</p>

<p>It has appeared to some that the South has
not done its full duty by the Negro. Perfection
is, without doubt, a standard above humanity;
but, at least, we of the South can say that we
have done much for him; if we have not admitted
him to social equality, it has been under
an instinct stronger than reason, and in obedience
to a law higher than is on the statute-books:
the law of self-preservation. Slavery,
whatever its demerits, was not in its time the
unmitigated evil it is fancied to have been. Its
time has passed. No power could compel the
South to have it back. But to the Negro it was
salvation. It found him a savage and a cannibal
and in two hundred years gave seven
millions of his race a civilization, the only civilization
it has had since the dawn of history.</p>

<p>We have educated him; we have aided him;
we have sustained him in all right directions.
We are ready to continue our aid; but we will
not be dominated by him. When we shall be,
it is our settled conviction that we shall deserve
the degradation into which we shall have sunk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">OF THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The question is often asked, “Now
that the race problem in the South
has been laid down and discussed,
what solution of it do you offer—what have you
to propose to ameliorate the conditions which
have grown out of that problem?”</p>

<p>The answer is simple. None, but to leave it
to work itself out along the lines of economic
laws, with such aid as may be rendered by an
enlightened public spirit and a broad-minded
patriotism. The solution proposed so glibly by
ignorant doctrinaires is like the nostrum of the
quack—good only for fools. The single solution
that can really solve it is that which time
alone can disclose—the natural and imperative
resultant of the forces represented in the two
races. The racial traits, instincts, and forces
which have governed and propelled them since
the dawn of history will in all human probability
still control and propel them so long as they
exist as races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>One fact that may be stated with some degree
of assurance is that there is no one universal
Negro problem or question except the single
one constituted by the existence in the same
country of two populous and fecund races, essentially
and, perhaps, radically different in
their history, manners, life, and instincts. In
fact, the problems are almost as numerous and
as various as the communities where the two
races exist side by side. For example, one
problem exists where the races are equally educated;
another, where they are equally ignorant;
a third, where the one race or the other is in
numerical superiority; yet another, where the
members of either race are of one class or another.
All of these things have to be fully considered
in determining the various questions that
seem to be inherent in the subject, and any positive
formulation of one set of conditions may
readily be met by the production of a partially
if not a totally different set of conditions.</p>

<p>Out of all these questions, as has been stated,
but one essentially common to the whole obtrudes
itself: Whether two races, like the white
race and the black, with such histories and such
characteristics as those races have, can continue
permanently to live together under conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
similar to those which exist in the United States
with mutual benefit to both?</p>

<p>On the proper answer to this question depends
our future, both as a people and as a
nation. Next to the question of Representative
government, this would appear to be the most
vital and fundamental question that exists
within the limits of the United States to-day.
Hinging upon it are such subordinate questions
as representation, personal security, freedom of
speech, race integrity, national strength and
permanency, and, possibly, even national existence.</p>

<p>The Negro race has already doubled three
times in the United States since the beginning
of the last century, and, unless conditions
change, it is possible that before the end of the
century there may be between sixty and eighty
millions of Negroes in this country; a situation
which will tax all, and more than all, of the
wisdom and constancy of the white race.</p>

<p>In fact, the situation is already too serious
to be disposed of without the expenditure of all
the courage, wisdom, and patriotism of the entire
white race in America, or, at least, without
more than they have yet shown. Hitherto, the
Negro race has been treated on the one side as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
an amiable and servile class, useful under regulation
and direction to furnish the labor of a
great section, and on the other side as a pliable
class, useful under certain conditions as a
weapon to punish or control the opposite party.
The one section has leaned decidedly to keeping
the Negro as a mere laborer; the other has
leaned with firmness to using him for its own
advantage. But, when the Negro race shall
reach the numbers suggested, new questions will
have arisen. The question then will be, “What
shall be done with this colored population of
sixty to eighty millions of souls?”</p>

<p>It is true that prognostications of increase in
a population often fail, but judging the future
by the past and taking into account known
racial characteristics, it would appear that the
number thus prophesied will in all human probability
exist in the United States by the end of
the century. If it does exist, it is useless for
us of the present generation to blink our eyes to
the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>The answer at present would appear to be
alternative: either they must live separately
among us—that is, a people within a people,
separate and distinct—or they must be amalgamated
and mixed in with the whites; or, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
must be removed and still live separate and distinct,
whether in some country beyond the confines
of the United States, or in some portion of
this country which shall be given up to them.</p>

<p>It is not believed by those best acquainted
with the subject that the solution of the race
question will ever be along the lines of amalgamation.
That there will be some intermixture
is doubtless true, but unless all observations
are erroneous, while the percentage of mulattoes
in the total Negro population has increased,
this increase is mainly due to the intermixture
of the white with the mulatto, or of the mulatto
with the pure Negro, and the intermixture
between the pure Negro and the pure white is
growing less all the time.</p>

<p>“The general conclusion,” says the Director
of the Department of Commerce and Labor of
the Census Bureau, after giving tables of increasing
per cent. of mulattoes to total Negro
population of the several divisions of the country,
“seems warranted that the proportion of
mulattoes to total Negroes was found by the
enumerators to be high or low, according as the
proportion of whites to Negroes is high or low.
That is, it appears that where the whites are in
large numbers and the Negroes in small numbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
the proportion of mulattoes to Negroes
is likely to be higher than where the whites are
in small numbers and the Negroes in large
numbers.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the percentage of mulattoes in
the total Negro population is decidedly greater
in cities than in the country.</p>

<p>Although the reports are admittedly incomplete,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
“yet even so,” says the Director, “it
is a step away from ignorance to have the observation
of many thousand enumerators at
four independent inquiries as evidence that in
the United States between one-ninth and one-sixth
of the Negroes were of mixed blood, while
in Cuba one-half and in Porto Rico five-sixths
have been so classed by the census.”</p>

<p>As race feeling grows the intermixture of
the two races will necessarily grow less and
less.</p>

<p>The solution of the question, then, must be
along one of the other lines suggested. That
is, the Negro race must either remain distinct
and keep to itself, or it must be removed to
some region, whether within or without the
confines of the United States, where it will be
substantially separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>There are those who advocate warmly the
attempt, however apparently Herculean, to remove
the Negro race without further delay.
That it may come to this in the future is certainly
possible. It is, however, much more
likely that the Negro race will find its best
security in remaining in this country, a people
within a people, separate and distinct,
but acting in amity with the stronger race
and trying to minimize rather than magnify
contentions upon those points as to which the
stronger race is most determined. Should the
time ever come when, for any reason whatever,
a conflict arises between the two races, which
would appear to jeopard the supremacy of the
stronger race, the weaker race would go down,
never to rise again on this continent.</p>

<p>When the writer first began to study the conditions
of the race problem they appeared to be
most disheartening. As, however, he surveyed
the entire field, he has become more hopeful,
and certainly more firm in his convictions as to a
few principles.</p>

<p>One of these principles is the absolute and
unchangeable superiority of the white race—a
superiority, it appears to him, not due to any
mere adventitious circumstances, such as superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
educational and other advantages during some
centuries, but an inherent and essential superiority,
based on superior intellect, virtue, and constancy.
He does not believe that the Negro is
the equal of the white, or ever could be the
equal. Race superiority is founded on courage
(or, perhaps, “constancy” is the better word),
intellect, and the domestic virtues, and in these
the white is the superior of every race.</p>

<p>Another principle is that many, if not most, of
the difficulties of the race problem since the war
have been caused, or at least increased, by the
ignorance of those outside of the South, who,
most cocksure of their position where they were
most in error, have tried to force a solution on
lines contrary to natural and unchangeable laws.
The selfish politician and the cocksure theorist
have equally contrived to create problems where
none might have been but for their bigotry and
their folly.</p>

<p>The first step toward the solution of the
problem would be taken if the Negro were simply
let alone and left to his own resources,
with such help as equity or philanthropy might
contribute—in other words, if the whites and
blacks were left to settle their difficulties and
troubles in the various States and sections precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
as they would be left were all whites or
all blacks.</p>

<p>Among the errors made in the early years
none was more fatal than the inculcation in the
mind of the Negro that he was the ward of
the nation, and, as such, would be sustained.
He was not sustained in the end and he never
can be; but he learned just enough from the
experience of that time to know that the Government
was powerful enough to trample down
the Southern whites. The memory of that time
has been an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> to delude him ever
since. And the continual harping on this theme
by the section of the Northern press and the
politicians, who forget that this is no longer the
decade following the war, is just sufficient to
mislead them.</p>

<p>At the end the Negroes must rise by their
own exertions and their own approach to the
standards by which peoples rise. And the chief
aid in this is the sympathy of those among
whom they live.</p>

<p>Left alone, the whites and the blacks of the
South would settle their difficulties along the
lines of substantial justice and substantial equity.</p>

<p>Yet another principle is that the final settlement
must be one in which the great body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
that portion of the white race who know the
Negroes best shall acquiesce. No other will
ever be final.</p>

<p>The “MacVeagh Commission,” which visited
Louisiana in 1876, reported that the Negro
party had a great majority in the State, had had
possession of every branch of the State Government,
and had been sustained by the United
States Government, and yet the whites had defeated
and ousted them. Were the same conditions
to exist to-day the same results would
occur. This country is as “fatally reserved
for” the Anglo-Saxon race as it was when the
Virginia Adventurers declared it to be so in
their first report to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>And, lastly, I am satisfied that the final
settlement must be by the way of elevating both
races.</p>

<p>There is much truth in the saying that unless
the whites lift the Negroes up, the Negroes will
drag them down, though it is not true in the full
sense in which it was intended. It is not true
to the extent that the white must lift the Negro
up to his own level; it is true to the extent that
he must not leave him debased—at least, must
not leave him here debased. If he does, then
the Negro will inevitably hold him, if not drag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
him down. No country in the present state of
the world’s progress can long maintain itself
in the front rank, and no people can long maintain
themselves at the top of the list of peoples
if they have to carry perpetually the burden of
a vast and densely ignorant population, and
where that population belongs to another race,
the argument must be all the stronger. Certainly,
no section can, under such a burden,
keep pace with a section which has no such burden.
Whatever the case may have been in the
past, the time has gone by, possibly forever,
when the ignorance of the working-class was an
asset. Nations and peoples and, much more,
sections of peoples, are now strong and prosperous
almost in direct ratio to their knowledge
and enlightenment.</p>

<p>It can readily be demonstrated by unquestioned
proof that the wealth and strength of
modern nations are in almost exact proportion
to the education of the population. It is not,
however, necessary for the present argument
to go outside of America. Viewing the matter
economically, the Negro race, like every other
race, must be of far more value to the country
in which it is placed, if the Negro is properly
educated, elevated, and trained, than if he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
allowed to remain in ignorance and degradation.
He is a greater peril to the community in
which he lives if he remains in ignorance and
degradation than if he is enlightened. If the
South expects ever to compete with the North,
she must educate and train her population, and,
in my judgment, not merely her white population,
but her entire population.</p>

<p>I know well all the arguments against educating
the Negroes. I know the struggle that the
South made in the days of her poverty to educate
that race, even at the expense of her white
children; expending upon them, out of taxes
levied by the whites on the property of the
whites, over $110,000,000, though over a fifth
of the whites were left in ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> I know
the disappointment from which she has suffered.
What is charged as to the educated Negro’s
being just educated enough to make him worthless
as a laborer and leave him useless for anything
else has in it often too much truth. I am
well aware that often the young Negro thinks
his so-called education gives him a license to
be insolent, and that not rarely it is but an aid
to his viciousness. But, for all this, the economic
laws are as invariable and as certain in
their operation as any other laws of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, it seems to me that our
plain duty is to do the best we can to act with
justice and a broad charity and leave the consequences
to God.</p>

<p>But there are other reasons for our continuing
in well-doing. And not for sentimental
reasons and not for political reasons, but for
reasons on which depend the future of the
South and of the Southern people; for reasons
as certain as that light is safer than darkness,
and that intelligence is better than stupidity, or
even mere craftiness, the South must educate
all her population. She must do this, or she
must fall behind the rest of the country. She
has no option in this matter. She has the population
and they are increasing. The matter
seems to me to be not susceptible of question
on sound economic grounds. We must educate
them. It is not a question of choice, but of
necessity.</p>

<p>We have the Negro here among us to the
number of ten millions and increasing at a rate
of about twenty-five per cent. every ten years.
They are here; what must we do with them?
One of three courses must be taken: We must
either debase them, keep them stationary, or
improve them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>Everyone will discard the first plan.</p>

<p>No one can make the second feasible. A
race, like a class, is always in a state of change,
at least, under conditions like those in America.</p>

<p>Then, we must adopt the third course.</p>

<p>At this point, the question arises: How shall
they be improved? One element says, Improve
them, but only as laborers, for which alone they
are fitted; another, with a larger charity, says,
Enlarge this and give them a chance to become
good mechanics, as they have shown themselves
capable of improvement in the industrial field;
a third class goes further yet, and says, Give
them a yet further chance—a chance to develop
themselves; enlighten them and teach them the
duties of citizenship and they will become measurably
good citizens. Yet another says, Give
him the opportunity and push him till he
is stuffed full of the ideas and the learning that
have made the white race what it is.</p>

<p>The last of these theories appears to the writer
as unsound as the first, which is certainly unsound.
Keep them ignorant, and the clever and
the enterprising will go off and leave to the
South the dull, the stupid, and the degraded.</p>

<p>The question is no longer a choice between
the old-time Negro and the “new issue,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
between the “new issue,” made into a fairly
good laborer and a fairly enlightened citizen,
who in time will learn his proper place, whatever
it may be, or the “new issue,” dull, ignorant,
brutish, liable to be worked on by the
most crafty of those who would use him; a
noisome, human hot-bed, in which every form
of viciousness will germinate.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the best argument ever advanced
for general suffrage was that of George Mason
in the Constitutional Convention: that through a
general suffrage it may be known what is underneath.
The Negroes will always have their
leaders, and it is better to have enlightened leaders
than ignorant.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more disheartening than
the poor return that the Southerner has received
for his outlay and patience. Often,
worthlessness and insolence on the part of the
beneficiaries of his bounty, and misunderstanding
and abuse on the part of Pharisaical critics,
have been his reward. But, for all this, let us
keep on doing what we believe to be right. We
have in the past had experience of the Negro
fairly well trained and in amity with the white,
where he recognized the latter’s superiority.
We have the high authority of one of the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
Negro teachers and leaders, that the Negro
yearns toward the white. This is strongly
corroborated by the well-known fact that wherever
the Negroes and the Southern whites are
let alone, and are not affected by outside influences,
they, for the most part, live in harmony.
If we keep on and manage the race question
with firmness and with equity, we shall yet show
the Negro that his true interest lies in maintaining
amity with the Southern white. This we
can never do if we take ground against educating
him and leave the Northern white to advocate
uplifting him. In such case, the North
would always have an argument, and the Negro
always proof, that the Northerner is his
friend and the Southerner not.</p>

<p>The alleged danger of the educated Negro
becoming a greater menace to the white than
the uneducated is a bugaboo which will not
stand the test of light. That this might be
true if the white is allowed to remain uneducated,
may readily be admitted. The answer,
however, to the argument, if it has any merit
whatever, is that we must give a sound and not
a spurious education and simply educate our
whites better. If there were not a Negro on
the continent of America, we shall have to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
this anyhow, unless we are willing to have the
Southern people fall ever further and further
behind the people of the North and West.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Education is now the talisman—the desire
and aim of all the vast influx of immigrants who
come within our gates. The children of the
foreign-born population of the country are, by
the last census, less illiterate, even in the North,
than those of the native-born. Unless we furnish
these people good schools, we can never
hope to get a good class of immigrants to come
to us. Without good schools, if we get any, it
will be only the poorest class. And nothing
would help us more in the South than to get in
the best class.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now, as to the form of education which will
be of most value to the Negroes and of most
value to the South—for the two, instead of
being opposed to each other, as, according to
our self-righteous critics, we appear to believe,
are bound up in one.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the system of education heretofore
pursued with the Negroes has been so futile
in its results that a considerable proportion
of Southerners, knowing the facts against all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the assertion of Negro leaders, and all the
clamor of those outside the South who are ignorant
of the facts, believe sincerely that the educated
are more worthless and more dangerous
to the welfare and peace of the community in
which they live than the uneducated.</p>

<p>That is, it is the sincere belief of a considerable
number of enlightened and thoughtful
whites, perfectly conversant with the situation,
that the earnest effort of the South to educate
the Negroes, extending through a generation,
at an expense of over $110,000,000, contributed
out of the property of the Southern whites,
has been a complete failure in that the beneficiaries
of this effort are not as good workers,
or as good citizens, as the generation which preceded
them, and use the education so given
them, where they use it at all, in ways which
are not beneficial to themselves and are injurious
to the whites.</p>

<p>This is a condition sufficiently grave to require
thoughtful consideration, and it must be
met by argument rather than by vilification, or
even by mere dogmatism.</p>

<p>It is, undoubtedly, true that the apparent result
of the effort to educate the Negro has been
disappointing. There are a few thousand professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
men, a considerable number of college
or high school graduates, but, for the
greater part, there is discernible little apparent
breadth of view, no growth in ability, or tendency
to consider great questions reasonably.
There is, indeed, rather a tendency to racial
solidarity in opposition to the whites on all questions
whatsoever; continued failure to distinguish
soundly between outward gifts and character;
a general inclination to deny crime and
side with criminals against the whites, no matter
how flagrant the crime may be. There is, moreover,
a not rare belief among the whites that
the preachers and leaders contribute to increase
these tendencies and teach hostility rather than
try to uplift the race morally. This view is
held sincerely by a considerable section of the
well-informed whites of the South.</p>

<p>All this is very disappointing, and yet the
only lamp by which we can guide our way safely
is the light of experience. Enlightenment and
religion are the two great powers that have
raised races and peoples. Since the dawn of
history, Education and Christianity have raised
the Western nations, among them the Anglo-Saxon
race. With all the faults men show in
practice, these two contain the vital principles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
They are founded on those precepts, by which
alone nations rise and civilization advances—knowledge,
morality, and duty.</p>

<p>Whatever disappointment, then, there may
be, this much at least may be laid down: There
are only two ways to solve the Negro problem
in the South. One is to remove him; the other
is to elevate him. The former is apparently out
of the question. The only method, then, is to
improve him.</p>

<p>In suggesting the method of education that
will prove of greatest service, it is easier to
criticise than to reform. Hitherto, the idea has
been to educate the Negro race just as the white
race is educated; that is, to give him book education
and “turn him loose.” There was, it
is true, no field except the curious politics of
the time in which the Negro could exercise his
powers, based on such an education. The whites
did not want this; the Negroes could not use it;
but this made no difference with those who had
the matter in charge. Education was understood
to be ability to show book-learning. With
this meagre equipment, the “educated Negro”
rushed into politics, or into the pulpit, which
mainly was but another name for the same
thing. Sentiment, however, demanded that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
Negro should be placed on an equality with the
whites, and other conditions were left out of
account, with disheartening results.</p>

<p>It is axiomatic to say that the education given
to the Negro should be of the kind which will
benefit him most. A few plain principles may
be stated: He should be taught that education
consists of something more than a mere ability
to read and write and speak; that education
includes moral elevation as well as intellectual
development; that religion includes morality
and is more than emotional excitement. He
should be taught that one of the strongest elements
in racial development is purity of family
life; he should be taught that the duties of
citizenship are much more than the ability to
cast a ballot, or even to hold an office; that elevation
to superiority among the people of his
own race is of far greater moment to him at
this time than external equality with another
race, and that true superiority is founded on
character. He should be taught to become self-sustaining,
self-reliant, and self-respecting. A
people, like a class, to advance must either be
strong enough to make its way against all hostility,
or must secure the friendship of others,
particularly of those nearest it. If the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
race in the South proposes, and is powerful
enough to overcome the white race, let it try this
method—it will soon find out its error; if not,
it must secure the friendship of that race. Owing
to conditions, the friendship and the sympathy
of the Southern section of that race are
almost as much more important to the Negro
race than is that of the North, as the friendship
of the latter is more important than that of the
yet more distant Canadian section of the white
race.</p>

<p>The best way—perhaps the only way—for
the Negro race to progress steadily is to secure
the sympathy and aid of the Southern whites.
It will never do this until the race solidarity of
the Negroes is broken and the Negroes divide
on the same grounds on which the whites divide;
until they unite with the whites and act with
them on the questions which concern the good
of the section in which they both have their
most vital interests.</p>

<p>The urgent need is for the Negroes to divide
up into classes, with character and right conduct
as the standard for elevation. When they make
distinctions themselves, others will recognize
their distinctions.</p>

<p>As a result of the above principles, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
appear, first, that elementary education should
be universal. Even the commonest laborer,
speaking in general terms, profits by it.</p>

<p>This education should be of the kind best
adapted to the great body of those for whom
it is provided. The wisest and most conservative
teacher of the Negro race, following the
precepts of his own great teacher, General
Armstrong, has attained his distinction largely
by the success he has achieved in applying methods
of industrial, rather than of mere literary
education. In this view he is bitterly opposed
by many, perhaps by most, of the “educated
Negroes,” who are fond of declaring that they
act upon principle; that the object of education
is to make men, not to make potatoes, or even
to make carpenters; little realizing that “men,”
in the sense in which the term is, or should be
used, are no more made by the superficial and
counterfeit education which most of their so-called
college graduates display, than are vegetables
or mechanics. It has taken a generation
and something like $150,000,000, including the
entire input from public and private sources, to
produce one Booker T. Washington, and—to
select from the other school—one Professor
Du Bois, though I take pleasure in stating my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
belief that there are a considerable and possibly
an increasing number of modest, unassuming,
faithful, and devoted teachers and representatives
of both schools not so distinguished, but,
perhaps, not less worthy than these. But, the
question arises, or should arise, How many thousands
are there who, in the making of these, have
been ruined for the life for which they were
fitted?</p>

<p>It might seem that the true principle should
be elementary education for all, including in
the term “industrial education,” and special,
that is, higher education of a proper kind for
the special individuals who may give proof of
their fitness to receive and profit by it.</p>

<p>A college education should be the final reward
and prize only of those who have proven
themselves capable of appreciating it and who
give promise of being able to use it for the
public good.</p>

<p>To ignore rules founded on such plain common
sense is worse than folly. The money so
expended is not merely thrown away; this might
be tolerated; it is an actual and positive injury.
It unfits the recipient for the work for which
alone in any case he might be fit, and gives him
in exchange only a bauble to amuse himself with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
or a weapon with which to injure himself and
others.</p>

<p>Finally, and as the only sound foundation
for the whole system of education, the Negro
must be taught the great elementary truths of
morality and duty. Until he is so established
in these that he claims to be on this ground
the equal of the white, he can never be his equal
on any other ground. When he is the equal of
the white, it will make itself known. Until
then, he is fighting not the white race, but a
law of nature, universal and inexorable—that
races rise or fall according to their character.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">As small as may appear to be the amount
expended by the South on public education,
those who have not known
conditions there can have little idea as to the
strain upon her resources which this amount has
caused. In “The Present South,” pp. 42, 43
<em>et seq.</em>, Edgar Gardner Murphy says:</p>

<p>“The figures of our national census show that
from 1860 to 1870 there was a fall of $2,100,000,000
in the assessed value of Southern
property and that the period of Reconstruction
added, in the years from 1870 to 1880, another
$67,000,000 to the loss.</p>

<p>“In 1860 the assessed value of property in
Massachusetts was $777,000,000, as contrasted
with $5,200,000,000 for the whole South.</p>

<p>“But at the close of the war period Massachusetts
had, in 1870, $1,590,000,000 in taxable
property, as contrasted with but $3,000,000,000
for the whole South.</p>

<p>“It is interesting to note that in 1890 there
was ‘expended for public schools on each $100
of true valuation of all real and personal property’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
22.3 cents in Arkansas and 24.4 cents in
Mississippi, as compared with 20.5 cents in
New York and 20.9 in Pennsylvania. See Report

<h3>ILLITERACY IN THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p>The following is taken from Publication 8,
Twelfth United States Census:</p>

<p>“The illiteracy of the native white population
of the Southern States ranges from 8.6 per cent.
in Florida, 8 per cent. in Mississippi, and 6.1
per cent. in Texas, to 17.3 per cent. in Louisiana,
and 19.5 per cent. in North Carolina, as
contrasted with 0.8 per cent. in Nebraska, 1.3
per cent. in Kansas, 2.1 per cent. in Illinois,
1.2 per cent. in New York, and 0.8 per cent. in
Massachusetts. A far juster comparison, however,
is that which indicates the contrast, not
between the South and the rest of the country in
1900, but between the South of 1880 and the
South of to-day.’</p>

<p>“There are 352 counties in the United States

these counties are in the South.</p>

should remain up to their present standards,
but not improve, and should impart the elements
of education to as large a proportion of
the rising generation as they have done to those
between 10 and 14 years in 1900, then, at the
end of the generation, illiteracy among the Negroes
in the country will have sunk from 44.5
to 30.1 per cent.; that is, nearly one-third of it
will have disappeared. At the same time, illiteracy
among the whites in the country will have
sunk, immigration aside, from 6.2 to 3.5 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
cent.; that is, about three-sevenths of the illiteracy
among the whites will have disappeared.</p>

<p>“At the present time, nearly one-half of the
Negroes in the Southern States are unable to
write, but if educational facilities for that race
remain about as they are at present for another
generation, and be availed of to the same extent,
the proportion would sink to one-third. The
illiteracy of the Negro at the present time is
about four times that of the white in both the
North and the South; in the North a little less,
in the South a little more.”</p>

<p>Now, if we use the percentages on preceding pages and
allow all the taxes paid by Negroes (on both personal and real
property) to go into the School Fund, we will see that there
was a deficit of $256,824.33 to be made up from the taxes paid
by white people, or, in other words, the total amount of taxes
on personal and real property paid by the Negroes will cover
less than half the expense of their schools alone.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
